Although Borku remains a work in progress, this case study highlights the significant steps taken to establish a unique and culturally focused platform.\n\n## The Vision: Showcasing African Cuisine\nBorku was created to celebrate the diversity of African cuisine through a specialized food delivery platform. To achieve this, the team focused on several key areas:\n\n### Customized Menu Items\nBorku required menu options that reflected various African cuisines, showcasing the rich culinary heritage across the continent.\n\n### User-Friendly Interface\nA UI and UX overhaul was needed to offer users an engaging, easy-to-navigate platform that embraced African-themed aesthetics.\n\n### Streamlined Onboarding\nTo attract both riders and restaurants, Borku needed a simplified onboarding process with forms tailored to each group.\n\n### Seamless Payment Integration\nStripe was integrated to enable smooth, secure transactions.\n\n## Key Development Highlights\n\n### Customizing the Menu for African Cuisine\nTo emphasize the diversity of African food, Borku’s team created unique menu options that cater to regional tastes.

The design incorporates vibrant, authentic African elements, making the app visually appealing while offering smooth navigation for users.\n\n### Simplified Onboarding with Rider and Restaurant Forms\nTo encourage engagement with the platform, Borku introduced custom forms to help new riders and restaurants join the network. These forms collect essential information and guide each party through the onboarding process, making it easier for vendors and drivers to start operating on Borku.\n\n### Secure and Convenient Stripe Payment Integration\nFor reliable and versatile payment handling, Borku integrated Stripe, providing users with a secure, familiar method for completing transactions. This setup also ensures that payments are processed quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n## Moving Forward with Borku\nBorku’s journey is just beginning.

It is specifically designed for college students who want food delivered to their dorm rooms or within their college campuses. Easy Eats differentiates itself from other food delivery services like UberEats and Grubhub by employing only student drivers and offering more options tailored to college students, while also emphasizing student-focused features.\n\n## Getting Started\nEasy Eats began as a passion project by a group of college students aiming to simplify life for their peers on campus. The founders entered the Greenlight Maine competition, which encourages entrepreneurs and innovators from various industries, including college students, to present their ideas for funding and support. Prior to this, Easy Eats collaborated with the Ninjas Code team to develop a solution that catered specifically to college students while incorporating features commonly found in competing services. They sought an app that would attract early investors and provide a unique user experience. The customizability of the Enatega solution facilitated the development of an ideal college food delivery app, despite encountering typical software development challenges.\n\n## The Development Journey\nThe Easy Eats team outlined the necessary features and customizations for their food delivery application. Following standard development practices, Ninjas Code gathered the requirements from the Easy Eats team and established a step-by-step process for implementing the required features. A clear roadmap was created to keep the development on track and provide a vision of the project timelines.\n\n### Designing A User-Friendly UI/UX\nThe initial focus for the Ninjas Code team was to create a clean and user-friendly experience for college students who would use the app to order and deliver food. The design team crafted a sleek and intuitive user interface that aligned with the Easy Eats brand. With an easy onboarding flow and a modern user experience, the team successfully brought Easy Eats' vision to life.\n\n### Student-Focused Features\nGiven that college students were the primary target audience, the app's features were designed with their needs in mind. A key feature was the ability to order food directly to dorm rooms, including options for group ordering to accommodate students sharing dorms.\n\n### Student Driver Onboarding\nAll riders for the Easy Eats app are fellow students, which is essential for ensuring quick deliveries to dorm rooms. Student drivers are familiar with the college's locations, allowing them to deliver orders directly without getting lost. The Ninjas Code team ensured that the rider onboarding process was straightforward, enabling Easy Eats to onboard as many riders as possible quickly.\n\n### Automatic Payment for Riders and Restaurants\nThe development team implemented a wallet feature for riders and restaurants, automating the payment process while ensuring accessibility. Both restaurants and riders can transfer funds from their wallets to their accounts almost immediately whenever needed.\n\n## Launching The App\nOnce all requested features for version 1.0 were completed, the app was ready for launch. The Easy Eats founders participated in the Greenlight Maine competition, where they presented their app to the judges. After showcasing the app's unique features, the Easy Eats team won the competition, receiving $25,000 to expand their operations. Subsequently, they launched the app at their college in Maine and extended operations to nearby universities."}

With an emphasis on white-label solutions, it allows businesses to tailor every element of their brand and service offering. \n\nIn contrast, Zeew is primarily focused on turnkey solutions for food and grocery delivery. It offers a straightforward setup but less flexibility in customization, making it a practical choice for simpler operations without the need for extensive branding control.\n\n---\n\n## Core Feature Comparison: Enatega vs. Zeew\n\n| Features                          | Enatega                          | Zeew                          |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Service Types Supported**       | Food, Grocery, Courier, More     | Mainly Food and Grocery Delivery |\n| **Customization Options**         | High Degree of Customization      | Limited Customization         |\n| **White-Label Capabilities**      | Yes, Fully White-Labeled         | Limited Branding Options      |\n| **Real-Time Tracking and Dispatch** | Advanced, Customizable Tracking Options | Standard Real-Time Tracking   |\n| **Payment Integrations**          | Supports Multiple Gateways and API Setups | Basic Payment Gateway Options |\n| **Scalability**                   | Highly Scalable, Multi-Service Support | Limited Scalability for Additional Services |\n\n---\n\n## Why Enatega is a Strong Alternative to Zeew\nEnatega’s extensive customization capabilities and versatile multi-service options make it an excellent alternative to Zeew, especially for businesses seeking a customizable app that grows alongside their needs.\n\n### Why Choose Enatega as a Zeew Alternative?\n\n#### Multi-Service Flexibility\nUnlike Zeew, which focuses on food and grocery delivery, Enatega supports a broad array of services, including courier, flower delivery, laundry, and roadside assistance.

Modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications. Enatega uses the Express JS framework and GraphQL for building the API. \n\n### Resolvers\nIn GraphQL, resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema. When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.\n\n### Dockerization\nDockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.\n\n### Database\nEnatega uses MongoDB to manage its database instead of SQL for database management. You can view MongoDB’s documentation by clicking here.\n\n## Resources\n- Blog\n- Documentation\n- Features\n- Compare\n  - Blink\n  - Deonde\n  - GloriaFood\n  - Ordering.Co\n  - Shipday\n  - SpotNeats\n  - Yelo\n  - Zeew\n\n## Case Studies\n- Yalla Delivery\n- Stylizenow\n- Easy Eats\n- Vinifynd\n- Snap Delivered\n- Borku Delivery\n\n## Get In Touch\n1021 E Lincolnway Suite #6581,  \nCheyenne, Wyoming 82001,  \nUnited States  \nsales@enatega.com  \n+1 (307) 776-8999  \n\n## Legal\n- Privacy Policy\n- Terms & Conditions  \n\n©2024 Enatega · All rights reserved.

Snap Delivered faced significant challenges in gaining market share amidst this competitive environment.\n\n### The Marketplace Dilemma\nAttracting both customers and restaurants to the platform was a significant hurdle. Convincing users to switch from their preferred platforms required extensive marketing efforts, and retaining both sides of the marketplace remained an ongoing challenge.\n\n### Rider Management\nManaging a large network of delivery riders and ensuring timely deliveries posed complex operational challenges. Snap Delivered needed to invest in reliable logistics and coordination systems to maintain efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n\n### Profitability\nOffering a flat rate of $2 per delivery was a bold strategy that pressured Snap Delivered’s profitability. Balancing the need to attract businesses with affordable rates while maintaining a sustainable business model proved to be a delicate task.\n\n## Overcoming The Challenges\n\n### Built Strategic Partnerships\nSnap Delivered established strategic partnerships with local restaurants, providing them with a unique value proposition.

Discounts, exclusive deals, and a user-friendly rewards system helped attract and retain both individual customers and restaurants.\n\n### Invested In Platform Upgrades\nRecognizing the importance of technology, Snap Delivered continually invested in upgrading its platform. Improvements included enhancing user experience, optimizing delivery routes, and implementing advanced data analytics to boost operational efficiency.\n\n### Initiated Referral Programs\nWhile maintaining an affordable flat rate, Snap Delivered introduced referral programs that allowed individuals to increase their income. This initiative provided various options for both individuals and businesses to earn money through recruitment and word-of-mouth advertising.\n\n## Launching Version 1.0\nThe development of Snap Delivered's first version was a race against time. The Ninjas Code team adopted an agile development approach, prioritizing features and making adjustments as needed. Regular feedback sessions with the Snap team ensured the project remained aligned with the initial vision.\n\n## The Future For Snap Delivered\nSnap Delivered’s strategic efforts to overcome challenges have yielded positive results.
