With a focus on cultural authenticity and user convenience, Borku aims to create a seamless experience for users craving African flavors. Although Borku remains a work in progress, this case study highlights the significant steps taken to establish a unique and culturally focused platform.\n\n## The Vision: Showcasing African Cuisine\nBorku was created to celebrate the diversity of African cuisine through a specialized food delivery platform. To achieve this, the team focused on a few key areas:\n\n### Customized Menu Items\nBorku required menu options that reflected various African cuisines, showcasing the rich culinary heritage across the continent.\n\n### User-Friendly Interface\nA UI and UX overhaul was needed to offer users an engaging, easy-to-navigate platform that embraced African-themed aesthetics.\n\n### Streamlined Onboarding\nTo attract both riders and restaurants, Borku needed a simplified onboarding process with forms tailored to each group.\n\n### Seamless Payment Integration\nStripe was integrated to enable smooth, secure transactions.\n\n## Key Development Highlights\n\n### Customizing The Menu For African Cuisine\nTo emphasize the diversity of African food, Borku’s team created unique menu options that cater to regional tastes. This customization allows restaurants to highlight popular dishes, from West African Jollof rice to North African tagines, providing users with a variety of options they won’t find on typical food delivery platforms.\n\n### User Interface And Experience Overhaul\nGiven the goal of creating a culturally resonant and user-friendly platform, Borku received a comprehensive UI and UX revamp. The design incorporates vibrant, authentic African elements, making the app visually appealing while offering smooth navigation for users.\n\n### Simplified Onboarding With Rider And Restaurant Forms\nTo encourage engagement with the platform, Borku introduced custom forms to help new riders and restaurants join the network. These forms collect essential information and guide each party through the onboarding process, making it easier for vendors and drivers to start operating on Borku.\n\n### Secure And Convenient Stripe Payment Integration\nFor reliable and versatile payment handling, Borku integrated Stripe, providing users with a secure, familiar method for completing transactions. This setup also ensures that payments are processed quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n## Moving Forward With Borku\nBorku’s journey is just beginning.

It is specifically designed for college students who want food delivered to their dorm rooms or within their college campuses. Easy Eats differentiates itself from other food delivery services like UberEats and Grubhub by employing only student drivers and offering more options tailored to college students, while also emphasizing student-focused features.\n\n## Getting Started\nEasy Eats began as a passion project by a group of college students aiming to simplify their peers' lives on campus. The founders entered the Greenlight Maine competition, which encourages entrepreneurs and innovators from various industries, including college students, to present their ideas for funding and support. Prior to this, Easy Eats collaborated with the Ninjas Code team to develop a solution that catered specifically to college students while incorporating features commonly found in competing services. They sought an app that would attract early investors and provide a unique user experience. The customizability of the Enatega solution facilitated the development of an ideal college food delivery app, despite encountering typical software development challenges.\n\n## The Development Journey\nThe Easy Eats team outlined the necessary features and customizations for their unique food delivery application. Following standard development practices, Ninjas Code gathered the Easy Eats team's requirements and established a step-by-step implementation process. A clear roadmap was created to keep development on track and provide a vision of the project's expected timelines.\n\n### Designing A User-Friendly UI/UX\nThe Ninjas Code team prioritized creating a clean and user-friendly experience for college students who would use the app to order and deliver food. The design team crafted a sleek and intuitive user interface that aligned with the Easy Eats brand. With an easy onboarding flow and a modern user experience, the team successfully brought Easy Eats' vision to life.\n\n### Student-Focused Features\nGiven that the primary audience for Easy Eats was college students, the features were tailored to their needs. A significant feature was the ability to order food directly to dorm rooms, including options for group ordering to accommodate students sharing dorms with roommates.\n\n### Student Driver Onboarding\nAll riders for the Easy Eats app are fellow students, which is essential for ensuring quick deliveries to dorm rooms. Student drivers are familiar with the college's locations, allowing them to deliver orders directly without getting lost. The Ninjas Code team ensured that the rider onboarding process was straightforward, enabling Easy Eats to onboard as many riders as possible quickly.\n\n### Automatic Payment For Riders And Restaurants\nThe development team implemented a wallet feature for riders and restaurants, automating the payment process while ensuring accessibility. Both restaurants and riders can transfer funds to their accounts directly from their wallets almost immediately whenever they choose.\n\n## Launching The App\nOnce all requested features for version 1.0 were completed, the app was ready for launch. The Easy Eats founders participated in the Greenlight Maine competition, where they presented their app to the judges. After showcasing the app's unique features, the Easy Eats team won the competition, receiving $25,000 to expand their operations. Subsequently, they launched the app at their college in Maine and expanded to other nearby universities."}

Node.js must be set up on your computer to run the module. The following commands should be entered in the directory after Node.js has been installed:\n\n```bash\ncd <Project directory> \n# e.g. cd enatega-multivendor-admin\n```\n\n### Change constants.js File\n\nYou need to change the following credentials in the constants.js file. To change the constants.js file, go to the `src` folder, then go to the `config` folder, where you will find `constants.js`.\n\nYou are required to incorporate the following values into this file:\n\n- `value#1` (SERVER_URL)\n- `value#2` (WS_SERVER_URL)\n- `value#3` (GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY)\n\nSubsequently, all other values will be retrieved from the database once saved through the configuration in the admin panel. Initially, if the values are not yet available from the configuration (database), please hardcode them into the `constants.js` file.\n\nThe configuration provided below is where you should append the values after executing the admin panel. These values are utilized across the entire project, including mobile apps, the web, and the admin interface.\n\nIn the admin panel under the configuration, you need to add all the values. As we have numbered each variable in the `constants.js` file, the explanation against each number is provided below:\n\n- **REACT_APP_SERVER_URL**: This variable specifies the base URL of your backend server that the web application will communicate with. It’s essential for making API requests to your server.\n  \n- **REACT_APP_WS_SERVER_URL**: This variable defines the WebSocket server URL. WebSockets are used for real-time communication, and this URL is crucial for establishing WebSocket connections with your server.\n\n### What is SERVER_URL?\n\nThis variable specifies the base URL of your server. It’s the root URL where your backend API is hosted.\n\n### So What is an API?\n\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. A backend API is responsible for handling data and requests on the server-side of a software application. The backend code of this project is the API for this project.\n\nTo make your API accessible to the internet, you need a hosting service.

{"url": "https://enatega.com/overview-of-the-api/", "title": "Overview of the API - Multi-Vendor Doc - Enatega", "slug": "overview-of-the-api", "domain": "enatega.com", "is_active": true, "source": "web", "text": "# Getting Started Overview of the API\n\n## About Our API\n\nEnatega’s API follows a monolithic architecture, which means that the entire software application is developed as a single, unified codebase. Consequently, any modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications. Enatega uses the Express JS framework and GraphQL for building the API. You can view the full GraphQL diagram below:\n\n### Resolvers\n\nIn GraphQL, Resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema. When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.\n\n### Dockerization\n\nDockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.\n\n### Database\n\nEnatega uses MongoDB to manage its database instead of SQL for database management. You can view MongoDB’s documentation by clicking here."}

Snap Delivered began its operations in 2019 with one big goal in mind: to disrupt the food delivery industry and challenge the standards and precedents already set by the industry leaders. These standards include aspects such as rider compensation and delivery charges for business owners. Snap Delivered provided an easy and transparent way to handle deliveries by charging business owners a set rate of only $2 per delivery. This flat rate not only allowed new business owners to use a service like Snap Delivered to automate deliveries but also helped level the playing field for restaurants of all sizes.\n\n## Challenges Faced By Snap Delivered\n\n### Highly Competitive Landscape\nThe food delivery industry is highly competitive, with established players like UberEats, Grubhub, and DoorDash dominating the market. Snap Delivered had to contend with these giants, making it challenging to gain significant market share.\n\n### The Marketplace Dilemma\nAttracting both customers and restaurants to the platform proved to be a daunting task. Convincing users to switch from their existing preferences and habits with other platforms required substantial marketing efforts. Moreover, retaining both sides of the marketplace posed an ongoing challenge.\n\n### Rider Management\nManaging a vast network of delivery riders and ensuring timely and accurate deliveries is a complex operational challenge. Snap Delivered had to invest in the latest and most reliable logistics and coordination systems to maintain efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n\n### Profitability\nOffering a flat rate of $2 per delivery to business owners was a bold move, but it also put pressure on Snap Delivered’s profitability. Balancing the need to attract businesses with affordable rates while maintaining a sustainable business model proved to be a delicate balancing act. This created a need for a safe and convenient alternative to traditional delivery options, which is where Snap Delivered came in.\n\n## Overcoming The Challenges\n\n### Built Strategic Partnerships\nSnap Delivered forged strategic partnerships with local restaurants, offering them a unique value proposition. By collaborating closely with small and medium-sized businesses, Snap Delivered differentiated itself from larger competitors and created a more inclusive platform.\n\n### Introduced Customer Incentives\nTo address user acquisition and retention challenges, Snap Delivered implemented customer incentives and loyalty programs. Discounts, exclusive deals, and a user-friendly rewards system helped attract and retain both individual customers and restaurants.\n\n### Invested In Platform Upgrades\nRecognizing the importance of technology in the industry, Snap Delivered continually invested in upgrading its platform. This included improving the user experience, optimizing delivery routes, and implementing advanced data analytics to enhance operational efficiency.\n\n### Initiated Referral Programs\nWhile maintaining an affordable flat rate, Snap Delivered introduced referral programs allowing anyone to increase their income. The various options provided to individuals as well as businesses meant that anyone involved with Snap Delivered could earn money via recruitment, word-of-mouth advertisement, or referrals."}
