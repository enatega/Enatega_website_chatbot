Consequently, any modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications.\n\nEnatega uses the Express JS framework and Graph QL for building the API. You can view the full Graph QL diagram below:\nResolversIn GraphQL, Resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema.\nWhen a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.\nDockerizationDockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.\nDatabaseEnatega uses Mongo DB to manage it’s database instead of SQL for database management.\n\nPayment options available to buy Enatega:\nCredit/Debit CardPaypalGPayWire TransferPayoneer"}

With a focus on cultural authenticity and user convenience, Borku aims to create a seamless experience for users craving African flavors. Although Borku remains a work in progress, this case study highlights the significant steps taken to establish a unique and culturally focused platform.\n\n## The Vision: Showcasing African Cuisine\nBorku was created to celebrate the diversity of African cuisine through a specialized food delivery platform. To achieve this, the team focused on a few key areas:\n\n### Customized Menu Items\nBorku required menu options that reflected various African cuisines, showcasing the rich culinary heritage across the continent.\n\n### User-Friendly Interface\nA UI and UX overhaul was needed to offer users an engaging, easy-to-navigate platform that embraced African-themed aesthetics.\n\n### Streamlined Onboarding\nTo attract both riders and restaurants, Borku needed a simplified onboarding process with forms tailored to each group.\n\n### Seamless Payment Integration\nStripe was integrated to enable smooth, secure transactions.\n\n## Key Development Highlights\n\n### Customizing The Menu For African Cuisine\nTo emphasize the diversity of African food, Borku’s team created unique menu options that cater to regional tastes. This customization allows restaurants to highlight popular dishes, from West African Jollof rice to North African tagines, providing users with a variety of options they won’t find on typical food delivery platforms.\n\n### User Interface And Experience Overhaul\nGiven the goal of creating a culturally resonant and user-friendly platform, Borku received a comprehensive UI and UX revamp. The design incorporates vibrant, authentic African elements, making the app visually appealing while offering smooth navigation for users.\n\n### Simplified Onboarding With Rider And Restaurant Forms\nTo encourage engagement with the platform, Borku introduced custom forms to help new riders and restaurants join the network. These forms collect essential information and guide each party through the onboarding process, making it easier for vendors and drivers to start operating on Borku.\n\n### Secure And Convenient Stripe Payment Integration\nFor reliable and versatile payment handling, Borku integrated Stripe, providing users with a secure, familiar method for completing transactions. This setup also ensures that payments are processed quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n## Moving Forward With Borku\nBorku’s journey is just beginning. With the foundational features now in place, the team is focusing on fine-tuning the user experience and exploring potential enhancements to expand Borku’s appeal. Future updates will continue to celebrate African cuisine, expanding options and improving usability.\n\n## What’s Next For Borku?\nBorku’s commitment to cultural authenticity and convenience reflects the versatility of Enatega’s platform and the creative expertise of Ninjas Code. By catering to African cuisine enthusiasts with a customized menu, engaging UI, and user-friendly features, Borku is poised to make a meaningful impact in the food delivery market as development progresses.\n\n## Get In Touch\n1021 E Lincolnway Suite #6581,  \nCheyenne, Wyoming 82001,  \nUnited States  \nsales@enatega.com  \n+1 (307) 776-8999"}

Log in with your Google Account or establish an account at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).\n2. Create a project in the Google Cloud Console.\n3. Activate the following APIs in your project:\n   - Geocoding API\n   - Maps Javascript API\n   - Places API\n   - Maps Elevation API\n   - Maps Static API\n   - Geolocation API\n   - Distance Matrix API\n   - Maps SDK for Android\n   - Maps SDK for iOS\n\n4. Set up the Google Billing account.\n\n5. Go to API & Services > Credentials from the left menu and select “Create Credentials.”  \n   - Create a key called HTTP Key, and add your website URL under the website restrictions tab. For example, if your website is my-domain.com, add:\n     - https://my-domain.com/*\n     - https://www.my-domain.com/*  \n   - Ensure you add an asterisk (*) at the end of the URL.\n\n6. Create another key named IP Key and paste your website/server IP address under the IP Addresses section.\n\n### Very Important\nThe IP address of your website might not always be sufficient to configure the IP limited key in a shared hosting environment. A pop-up notification may appear, indicating an issue with authorization. The message will look like this:  \n\"Geocoding failed because `This IP, site or mobile application is not authorized to use this API Key. Request received from IP address *.*.*.* with empty referer.\"  \nThe *.*.*.* represents your server’s IP address, which needs to be set on the IP Restricted key. Go back to the Google Cloud Console and set this IP Address provided in the popup.\n\n7. Modifications should be made to all modules that require GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY or googleMapsAPIkey, and all modifications should be saved.  \n   - It takes Google APIs 5 to 10 minutes to update your website.\n\n## Important Links\n- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com)\n- [Google Map Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps)\n- Find Website IP  \n\n# Next Steps\n- How to deploy Mobile Applications  \n- Nodemailer Setup  \n\n# Contact Information\nGet In Touch  \n1021 E Lincolnway Suite #6581,  \nCheyenne, Wyoming 82001, United States  \nsales@enatega.com  \n+1 (307) 776-8999  \n\n# Comparison\n- Blink  \n- Deonde  \n- GloriaFood  \n- Ordering.Co  \n- Shipday  \n- SpotNeats  \n- Yelo  \n- Zeew  \n\n# Case Studies\n- Yalla Delivery  \n- Stylizenow  \n- Easy Eats  \n- Vinifynd  \n- Snap Delivered  \n- Borku Delivery  \n\n# Resources\n## Blog  \n## Documentation  \n## Features"}

It is specifically designed for college students who want food delivered to their dorm rooms or within their college campuses. Easy Eats differentiates itself from other food delivery services like UberEats and Grubhub by employing only student drivers and offering more options tailored to college students, while also emphasizing student-focused features.\n\n## Getting Started\nEasy Eats began as a passion project by a group of college students aiming to simplify their peers' lives on campus. The founders entered the Greenlight Maine competition, which encourages entrepreneurs and innovators from various industries, including college students, to present their ideas for funding and support. Prior to this, Easy Eats collaborated with the Ninjas Code team to develop a solution that catered specifically to college students while incorporating features commonly found in competing services. They sought an app that would attract early investors and provide a unique user experience. The customizability of the Enatega solution facilitated the development of an ideal college food delivery app, despite encountering typical software development challenges.\n\n## The Development Journey\nThe Easy Eats team outlined the necessary features and customizations for their unique food delivery application. Following standard development practices, Ninjas Code gathered the Easy Eats team's requirements and established a step-by-step implementation process. A clear roadmap was created to keep development on track and provide a vision of the project's expected timelines.\n\n### Designing A User-Friendly UI/UX\nThe Ninjas Code team prioritized creating a clean and user-friendly experience for college students who would use the app to order and deliver food. The design team crafted a sleek and intuitive user interface that aligned with the Easy Eats brand. With an easy onboarding flow and a modern user experience, the team successfully brought Easy Eats' vision to life.\n\n### Student-Focused Features\nGiven that the primary audience for Easy Eats was college students, the features were tailored to their needs. A significant feature was the ability to order food directly to dorm rooms, including options for group ordering to accommodate students sharing dorms with roommates.\n\n### Student Driver Onboarding\nAll riders for the Easy Eats app are fellow students, which is essential for ensuring quick deliveries to dorm rooms. Student drivers are familiar with the college's locations, allowing them to deliver orders directly without getting lost. The Ninjas Code team ensured that the rider onboarding process was straightforward, enabling Easy Eats to onboard as many riders as possible quickly.\n\n### Automatic Payment For Riders And Restaurants\nThe development team implemented a wallet feature for riders and restaurants, automating the payment process while ensuring accessibility. Both restaurants and riders can transfer funds to their accounts directly from their wallets almost immediately whenever they choose.\n\n## Launching The App\nOnce all requested features for version 1.0 were completed, the app was ready for launch. The Easy Eats founders participated in the Greenlight Maine competition, where they presented their app to the judges. After showcasing the app's unique features, the Easy Eats team won the competition, receiving $25,000 to expand their operations. Subsequently, they launched the app at their college in Maine and expanded to other nearby universities."}

In this comparison, we explore how Enatega and Shipday stack up to help you determine if Enatega is the alternative to Shipday that best meets your business needs.\n\n### Overview Of Enatega And Shipday\n\nEnatega is a versatile, fully customizable delivery platform designed to support diverse service sectors. With options for food, grocery, courier, and more, Enatega enables businesses to create tailored, branded experiences. Shipday, on the other hand, is a delivery management solution focused on real-time tracking and efficient dispatching for local businesses.

This versatility makes Enatega a perfect choice for companies looking for apps like Shipday but with multi-service support.\n\n- **Branding and User Experience Control**  \n  Enatega’s white-label options offer full control over branding and user interface design, ensuring a seamless brand experience for users. This makes Enatega an ideal alternative for Shipday for businesses that need more comprehensive branding capabilities.\n\n- **Enhanced Payment and Tracking Options**  \n  While Shipday provides real-time tracking, Enatega offers more adaptable tracking features and multiple payment gateways, allowing businesses to create a streamlined customer experience that fits their specific market needs. This payment flexibility makes Enatega a top Shipday similar solution with additional benefits.\n\n- **Scalable and Supportive Platform**  \n  Enatega provides personalized support for onboarding and scalability, designed to grow with your business.

Designed for growth, Lumi delivers fast and intuitive services across the regional market.\n\nThe platform includes a Web App, Customer App, Admin Panel, and Rider App.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLumi is a next-generation super app based in Qatar. It is built on the Enatega framework and enhanced with proprietary AI extensions to create a unified ride-sharing and food delivery platform.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nLumi set out to address several market needs.\n\nService Fragmentation\nUsers in Qatar relied on multiple separate applications for transportation, food delivery, hospitality services, and travel. Lumi aimed to unify these services under one platform.\n\nAI-Driven Personalisation\nTraditional service apps in the region lacked intelligent recommendations and adaptive user experiences.\n\nMulti-Service Architecture\nIntegrating ride sharing, delivery, and future travel services into a single scalable application required rethinking the base architecture.\n\nLocal Relevance and Language Support\nQatar’s diverse population required support for both Arabic and English within the same interface.\n\nTo meet these demands, Lumi needed a scalable solution that could adapt quickly without compromising performance or user experience.\n\nDevelopment Journey\n\nLumi’s development was based on the Enatega white-label super app platform, selected for its modular architecture and on-demand service foundation. The framework was extended with a new ride-sharing module that included driver onboarding, trip management, real-time tracking, and dynamic pricing logic.\n\nStage I: Architectural Enhancement\n\nArtificial intelligence components were added to improve search relevance, tailor ride and food recommendations, and optimise routing for drivers and delivery partners.\n\nStage II: AI Features Integration\n\nAI capabilities were embedded to enhance personalisation, predictive searches, and contextual service suggestions.\n\nStage III: Localisation and Language Support\n\nThe user interface was fully localised with support for both right-to-left (Arabic) and left-to-right (English) layouts. Cultural and regional preferences guided UI design decisions throughout this stage.\n\nStage IV: Scalable Modules for Future Services\n\nHotel booking, flight reservations, and hospitality services were architected as independent modules, allowing them to be enabled without affecting core ride or delivery services.\n\nThe development process followed an iterative approach with continuous user testing to validate usability and responsiveness across services.\n\nKey Capabilities\nRide Sharing\n\nLumi offers fast rider-driver matching with transparent pricing and fare estimates. The experience includes options for tipping, discounts, and feedback, along with real-time tracking, trip updates, preferred language support, and local payment methods.\n\nFood Delivery\n\nThe food delivery service includes a wide selection of partner restaurants, seamless ordering with live order tracking, smart recommendations influenced by user behaviour, and integrated maps with delivery ETA visibility.\n\nAI-Powered Enhancements\n\nAI-driven features include intelligent suggestions tailored to user preferences, predictive searches based on prior activity, and context-aware ride and food options.\n\nScalable Architecture\n\nLumi is built on a modular architecture designed for future expansion into hotel, flight, and hospitality services. The platform supports shared user accounts across services and a unified payment system.\n\nLaunch and Results\n\nLumi’s rollout focused on stabilising core services in major population centres across Qatar. Early adoption demonstrated strong user interest in combined services."}

Early adoption demonstrated strong user interest in combined services.\n\nKey outcomes included rapid adoption with strong user retention, positive feedback on AI recommendations and interface simplicity, smooth onboarding of partner drivers and restaurants, and high engagement across both ride-sharing and food delivery services.\n\nFuture Service Expansion\n\nLumi is designed to extend into additional service areas.\n\nHotel Booking\nIntegration with global and regional hotel partners, supported by AI-based stay recommendations.\n\nFlight Booking\nSearch and booking across airlines with fare predictions and smart alerts.\n\nHospitality Services\nConcierge-level services including home cleaning, laundry, electrician, and other technical services.\n\nEach new capability is designed to integrate naturally within the existing app experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nLumi represents a pioneering initiative within Qatar’s digital ecosystem. By combining ride sharing and food delivery with artificial intelligence and a flexible architectural foundation, it delivers a compelling multi-service experience. Built on the Enatega framework and enhanced with customised modules, Lumi is positioned to expand into travel and hospitality while setting a new standard for super apps in the region."}

Consequently, any modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications. Enatega uses the Express JS framework and GraphQL for building the API. \n\nYou can view the full GraphQL diagram below:\n\n## Resolvers\n\nIn GraphQL, resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema. When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.\n\n## Dockerization\n\nDockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.\n\n## Database\n\nEnatega uses MongoDB to manage its database instead of SQL for database management. You can view MongoDB’s documentation by clicking here.\n\n# Contact Information\n\n1021 E Lincolnway Suite #6581,  \nCheyenne, Wyoming 82001,  \nUnited States  \nsales@enatega.com  \n+1 (307) 776-8999  \n\n# Comparison\n\nCompare:  \n- Blink  \n- Deonde  \n- GloriaFood  \n- Ordering.Co  \n- Shipday  \n- SpotNeats  \n- Yelo  \n- Zeew  \n\n# Case Studies\n\n- Yalla Delivery  \n- Stylizenow  \n- Easy Eats  \n- Vinifynd  \n- Snap Delivered  \n- Borku Delivery  \n\n# Resources\n\n- Blog  \n- Documentation  \n- Features  \n\n# Clones\n\n- Clone Blinkit  \n- Clone Deliveroo  \n- Clone Delivery Hero  \n- Clone Dunzo  \n- Clone Foodpanda  \n- Clone Glovo  \n- Clone Grubhub  \n- Clone Justeat  \n- Clone Postmates  \n- Clone Rappi  \n- Clone Swiggy  \n- Clone Talabat  \n- Clone Ubereats  \n- Clone Zepto  \n- Clone Zomato  \n\n# Use Cases"}

Discounts, exclusive deals, and a user-friendly rewards system helped attract and retain both individual customers and restaurants.\n\n### Invested In Platform Upgrades\nRecognizing the importance of technology, Snap Delivered continually invested in upgrading its platform. Improvements included enhancing the user experience, optimizing delivery routes, and implementing advanced data analytics to boost operational efficiency.\n\n### Initiated Referral Programs\nWhile maintaining an affordable flat rate, Snap Delivered introduced referral programs that allowed individuals to increase their income. The various options provided to individuals and businesses meant that anyone involved with Snap Delivered could earn money through recruitment, word-of-mouth advertisement, or referrals.\n\n## Launching Version 1.0\nThe development of Snap Delivered's first version was a race against time.

Regular feedback sessions with the Snap team ensured the project stayed on track and aligned with the initial vision.\n\n## The Future For Snap Delivered\nSnap Delivered’s strategic efforts to overcome challenges have yielded positive results.
