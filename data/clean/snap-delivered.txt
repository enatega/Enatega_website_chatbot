## What is Snap Delivered?

Snap Delivered is a food delivery platform powered by Enatega, similar to companies like Foodpanda and UberEats.  

Founded in 2019, Snap Delivered aimed to **disrupt the food delivery industry** by challenging existing standards, including:

- How much riders get paid  
- How much business owners are charged per delivery

It offered a **flat $2 per delivery** model for business owners.  
This transparent pricing:

- Enabled new restaurants to join easily  
- Automated their delivery operations  
- Leveled the playing field for small and large restaurants alike

## Challenges Faced by Snap Delivered

Despite its innovative approach, Snap Delivered faced several challenges:

### Highly Competitive Landscape
Competing against industry giants like UberEats, Grubhub, and DoorDash made market penetration difficult.

### The Marketplace Dilemma
Attracting both customers and restaurants required heavy marketing and incentives.  
Convincing users to switch from existing platforms was challenging, and retention was even harder.

### Rider Management
Managing a vast rider network and ensuring timely, accurate deliveries demanded investment in logistics systems.

### Profitability
Charging only $2 per delivery pressured profits.  
Balancing affordability for restaurants and sustainability for Snap Delivered was a delicate act.

This boosted user acquisition and retention for both customers and restaurants.

### Invested in Platform Upgrades

- User experience

### Initiated Referral Programs
