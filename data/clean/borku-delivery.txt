Project Overview
Basic Information
Borku is an African cuisine food delivery app built on the Enatega platform and customized by Ninjas Code. The platform focuses on cultural authenticity and user convenience while remaining a work in progress as an emerging platform. The core mission is to celebrate the diversity of African cuisine through a specialized food delivery service.
Project Vision

The goal is to showcase the rich culinary heritage across the African continent and establish a unique and culturally focused platform in the food delivery market.
Key Development Areas
Customized Menu Items
The objective was to reflect various African cuisines through the platform. Implementation involved creating unique menu options that cater to regional tastes, allowing restaurants to highlight popular dishes. The platform features diverse options from across Africa, including West African Jollof rice and North African tagines. This provides variety not typically found on standard food delivery platforms.

These forms collect essential information and guide each party through the onboarding process, making it easier for vendors and drivers to start operating on Borku.
