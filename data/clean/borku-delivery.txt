Borku is an emerging food delivery app centered on African cuisine, developed on Enatega and customized by Ninjas Code. With a focus on cultural authenticity and user convenience, Borku aims to create a seamless experience for users craving African flavors. Although Borku remains a work in progress, this case study highlights the significant steps taken to establish a unique and culturally focused platform.

## The Vision: Showcasing African Cuisine
Borku was created to celebrate the diversity of African cuisine through a specialized food delivery platform. To achieve this, the team focused on a few key areas:

### Customized Menu Items
Borku required menu options that reflected various African cuisines, showcasing the rich culinary heritage across the continent.

### User-Friendly Interface
A UI and UX overhaul was needed to offer users an engaging, easy-to-navigate platform that embraced African-themed aesthetics.

### Streamlined Onboarding
To attract both riders and restaurants, Borku needed a simplified onboarding process with forms tailored to each group.

### Seamless Payment Integration
Stripe was integrated to enable smooth, secure transactions.

## Key Development Highlights

### Customizing The Menu For African Cuisine
To emphasize the diversity of African food, Borku’s team created unique menu options that cater to regional tastes. This customization allows restaurants to highlight popular dishes, from West African Jollof rice to North African tagines, providing users with a variety of options they won’t find on typical food delivery platforms.

### User Interface And Experience Overhaul
Given the goal of creating a culturally resonant and user-friendly platform, Borku received a comprehensive UI and UX revamp. The design incorporates vibrant, authentic African elements, making the app visually appealing while offering smooth navigation for users.

### Simplified Onboarding With Rider And Restaurant Forms
To encourage engagement with the platform, Borku introduced custom forms to help new riders and restaurants join the network. These forms collect essential information and guide each party through the onboarding process, making it easier for vendors and drivers to start operating on Borku.

### Secure And Convenient Stripe Payment Integration
For reliable and versatile payment handling, Borku integrated Stripe, providing users with a secure, familiar method for completing transactions. This setup also ensures that payments are processed quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Moving Forward With Borku
Borku’s journey is just beginning. With the foundational features now in place, the team is focusing on fine-tuning the user experience and exploring potential enhancements to expand Borku’s appeal. Future updates will continue to celebrate African cuisine, expanding options and improving usability.
