# Getting Started

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide on deploying the Backend API server, Admin Dashboard, Web Dashboard, and Mobile Applications.

## High-Level Architecture
An overview of the API architecture is provided, along with frequently asked questions and licensing information.

## Installation Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

### How to Setup Locally
Instructions for setting up the environment locally.

### How to Setup/Deploy for Production
Guidelines for deploying the application in a production environment.

# Deploying the Backend API Server

## Step 1: Docker Setup
Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. If not, download it from the official website. Once installed, navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

## Step 2: Environment Variables
Configure the environment variables by modifying the `.env` file with your credentials. If the `.env` file is not present, create one in the root directory and include the following contents:

```
PORT=8001
CONNECTION_STRING=
RESET_PASSWORD_LINK=auth/reset/?reset=
SERVER_URL=https://enatega-multivendor.up.railway.app/
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET=
DASHBOARD_URL=https://practical-minsky-95a652.netlify.app/#/
WEB_URL=https://pensive-liskov-5320d4.netlify.app/
ORDER_DETAIL_WEB_URL=order-detail/
NODE_DEV=production
NODE_ENV=production
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
```

### Environment Variables Explanation
- **PORT**: The port number on which the server will run.
- **CONNECTION_STRING**: Contains the connection string for your MongoDB database.
- **RESET_PASSWORD_LINK**: Link for resetting passwords.
- **SERVER_URL**: Specifies the base URL of your server.
- **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET**: Used for Stripe webhook verification.
- **DASHBOARD_URL**: URL for the dashboard.
- **WEB_URL**: URL for the web application.
- **ORDER_DETAIL_WEB_URL**: Partial URL for specific order details.
- **NODE_DEV**: Node development environment.
- **NODE_ENV**: Node environment.
- **SENDGRID_API_KEY**: API key for SendGrid, if used for sending emails.

## Step 3: Adding serviceAccountKey.json
Add your `serviceAccountKey.json` file, which is used for Firebase Admin SDK. To obtain this file:
1. Go to the Firebase Console.
2. Select your project.
3. Navigate to Project Settings > Service accounts.
4. Click on “Generate new private key” to download the JSON file.
5. Replace the downloaded `serviceAccountKey.json` file in the project directory.

## Running the Backend
After completing the setup steps, start using your backend API. Run Docker with the following command to build and start the containers:

```
docker compose up --build
```

# Deploying the Admin Dashboard and Web Application
To deploy these applications, consider using hosting platforms like Netlify and Vercel.

## Deployment Steps

### Netlify
1. Connect your code repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab) to your Netlify account.
2. Specify the build settings and configurations for your dashboard and web app.
3. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your applications upon pushing changes to your repository.
4. Set custom domains or subdomains for your applications.

### Vercel
1. Connect your code repository and configure your settings.
2. Vercel will handle the build and deployment.
3. Custom domains can be set up to determine the URLs for your dashboard and web app.
