# StylizeNOW Overview

## Introduction
StylizeNOW is a platform that provides on-demand mobile hair and nail care services. Customers can easily select their desired services through the platform, which then connects them with a stylist.

## What Is StylizeNOW?
StylizeNOW operates as a connection point between customers and licensed professionals for on-demand salon services delivered directly to their homes. The platform specializes in haircuts, hair coloring, nail services, and eyelash care. Rather than employing stylists, StylizeNOW contracts individual providers who offer services via a mobile application. This allows for prompt arrangements for licensed professionals to visit customers' homes as soon as they select their desired services. In light of recent events, StylizeNOW offers a safer alternative to crowded indoor salons, supporting professionals who may have experienced work disruptions.
