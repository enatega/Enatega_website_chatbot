## What is StylizeNOW

StylizeNOW operates as a platform connecting customers with licensed professionals for on-demand salon services at their doorstep.  

Key service areas:

- Haircuts  
- Hair coloring  
- Nail services  
- Eyelash care  

Instead of employing stylists, StylizeNOW contracts with individual providers who deliver services using the mobile app.  

This provides a safer alternative during times when crowded indoor spaces pose health risks, supporting professionals who may face work disruptions.
