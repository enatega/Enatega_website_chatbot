# StylizeNOW Overview

## Introduction
StylizeNOW is a platform that provides on-demand mobile hair and nail care services. Customers can easily select their desired services through the platform, which promptly connects them with a licensed stylist.

## What Is StylizeNOW?
StylizeNOW operates as a connection point between customers and licensed professionals for on-demand salon services delivered right to their doorstep. The platform specializes in haircuts, hair coloring, nail services, and eyelash care. Rather than employing stylists directly, StylizeNOW contracts individual providers who offer services via the mobile application. This model allows for quick arrangements for licensed professionals to visit customers' homes, especially important during times when avoiding crowded spaces is crucial.

# Challenges Faced By StylizeNOW

   Before StylizeNOW, potential customers experienced delays due to waiting for salon appointments, traveling, and additional wait times for stylists to complete their services.

2. **Stylist Matching Difficulty**  
   Many individuals found it challenging to locate a stylist capable of delivering their desired hairstyle, a common issue prior to the introduction of StylizeNOW.

3. **Health Concerns and Pandemic Impact**  
   The COVID-19 pandemic heightened concerns about exposure to diseases in crowded salons, leading to a decrease in salon visits as people became more cautious about public spaces.
