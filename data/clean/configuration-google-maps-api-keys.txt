## Google Maps API Keys
### Video Walkthrough
Enatega Multivendor | Configuring Google Maps API Key Setup  

1. Log in with your Google Account or establish an account at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. Create a project in the Google Cloud Console.
3. Activate the following APIs in your project:
   - Geocoding API
   - Maps Javascript API
   - Places API
   - Maps Elevation API
   - Maps Static API
   - Geolocation API
   - Distance Matrix API
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS

4. Set up the Google Billing account.

5. Go to API & Services > Credentials from the left menu and select “Create Credentials.”  
   - Create a key called HTTP Key, and add your website URL under the website restrictions tab. For example, if your website is my-domain.com, add:
     - https://my-domain.com/*
     - https://www.my-domain.com/*  
   - Ensure you add an asterisk (*) at the end of the URL.

6. Create another key named IP Key and paste your website/server IP address under the IP Addresses section.

### Very Important
The IP address of your website might not always be sufficient to configure the IP limited key in a shared hosting environment. A pop-up notification may appear, indicating an issue with authorization. The message will look like this:  
"Geocoding failed because `This IP, site or mobile application is not authorized to use this API Key. Request received from IP address *.*.*.* with empty referer."  
The *.*.*.* represents your server’s IP address, which needs to be set on the IP Restricted key. Go back to the Google Cloud Console and set this IP Address provided in the popup.

7. Modifications should be made to all modules that require GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY or googleMapsAPIkey, and all modifications should be saved.  
   - It takes Google APIs 5 to 10 minutes to update your website.
