# Getting Started

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide on deploying mobile applications using Enatega Multivendor.

## High-Level Architecture
An overview of the API and its functionalities is provided, along with frequently asked questions, licensing information, and patch notes.

## Installation Prerequisites
Before setting up, ensure you have the necessary prerequisites in place.

### How to Setup Locally
1. Clone or download the source code from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command:
   ```
   cd <Project directory> e.g. cd enatega-multivendor-app
   ```

### How to Setup/Deploy for Production
Instructions for deploying the application in a production environment.

## Deploying Mobile Applications

### Complete Setup
1. Update the environment file (`/environment.js`).
   - Change the following credentials: `value#1`, `value#2`, and `value#3`. The remaining values will be retrieved from the configuration (database) once added through the admin panel. If these values are not obtained, hardcode them in the `environment.js` file.

### Environment Variables
Here are the variables in the `environment.js` file for the Mobile App, along with their purposes:

- **GRAPHQL_URL**: URL of the GraphQL endpoint for your API, essential for making GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **WS_GRAPHQL_URL**: WebSocket URL for real-time communication.
- **SERVER_URL**: Base URL of your server for API requests.

### Understanding APIs
An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software applications to communicate. The backend API handles data and requests on the server side.

### Hosting Your API
To make your API accessible, you need a hosting service. Options include cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Digital Ocean.

### How to Deploy the Backend API
Deploying involves uploading your code, configuring the server, and ensuring it’s operational. 

### Google OAuth Client IDs
- **IOS_CLIENT_ID_GOOGLE**: For iOS applications.
- **ANDROID_CLIENT_ID_GOOGLE**: For Android applications.

### Amplitude Integration
- **AMPLITUDE_API_KEY**: Essential for integrating Amplitude analytics into your application.

### Google Maps Integration
- **GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY**: Required for integrating Google Maps services.

### Expo Client ID
- **EXPO_CLIENT_ID**: For use within the Expo development environment.

### Sentry Configuration
- **SENTRY_DSN**: Used for error tracking and monitoring.

### Legal URLs
- **TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS**: URL to your app’s terms and conditions.
- **PRIVACY_POLICY**: URL to your app’s privacy policy.

### Additional Variables
- **TEST_OTP**: A test OTP for development.
- **GOOGLE_PACES_API_BASE_URL**: Base URL for the Google Places API.

### Running the Application
After setting the `.env` file, run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Submitting Mobile Apps to App and Play Store

### Creation of Builds
To create builds for both Android and iOS, enter the following commands in your terminal:
1. Install the EAS CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```
2. Log in to your Expo account:
   ```
   eas login
   ```
3. Create a new project in your Expo account.

### Building and Submitting
Run the following commands:
```
eas build:configure
eas build --profile production --platform android
eas build --profile production --platform ios
eas submit --platform ios
eas submit --platform android
```

### Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates
For OTA updates, run:
```
npx expo install expo-updates
eas update:configure
eas update --branch production --message "Example update"
```

## Enrollment in Developer Programs

### Apple Developer Program
