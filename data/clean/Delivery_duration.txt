# Deployment Duration

## If a user ask how long it will take to have the Apps live on stores you can answer something like this as advertised it can be done within 5 days but it has dependencies from your end and Apple or Google review time which can take 1 to 2 weeks from your end all the required steps on onboarding platform if given before such as Apple organisation account. 

You can also purchase right now directly on the onboarding platform and our team can start working on the branding and other related things and once the submission step is needed or any account that has dependency can be addressed at that time.

You will have full visibility after purchase on the onboarding platform directly.
