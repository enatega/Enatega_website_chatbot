## Frequently Asked Questions and Support Information

The platform addresses common implementation and usage questions to help businesses make informed decisions. The front-end of the solution is completely open-source and available to everyone, while the back-end and APIs are proprietary and can be acquired via paid license. Enatega is perfect for customers looking to deploy a readymade and easy to use platform for their food delivery and logistics business, similar to foodpanda and ubereats, with the ability to incorporate multiple restaurants as well as restaurants that operate in multiple locations.

The solution offers full customization capabilities, though additional changes outside the standard scope of work may be subject to further charges. Demos are easily available on the website and Youtube channel for comprehensive learning. The platform can be used anywhere in the world with global API integrations, and supports various payment methods including cash payments, debit/credit card via stripe, paypal, and other payment options that can be integrated with code modifications.

You can make changes yourself if you or your team is familiar with the tech stack, or Ninjas Code can handle deployment and customizations for clients who have purchased the backend. The company provides free 2 hours of consultation with the development team via Google Meet after purchase. While the product is considered the final version with no planned updates or maintenance, frontend updates are available through the repository when pushed.

Once you purchase the backend license, the code becomes your property and Enatega will not make any claims of ownership for any apps and platforms initiated using the acquired backend. With Enatega, you don't just rent software but fully own your food delivery marketplace, including customer, restaurant, and driver apps plus an admin panel, all delivered with complete source code. This means you can run your marketplace under your own brand, customize features to your needs, and scale without limits, unlike SaaS platforms that have monthly commissions or vendor lock-ins.
