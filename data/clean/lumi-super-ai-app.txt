Overview

Lumi is Qatar’s first all-in-one AI-powered super app. Built on the Enatega platform, it is a dynamic food and grocery delivery application offering a seamless bilingual experience. Designed for growth, Lumi delivers fast and intuitive services across the regional market.

The platform includes a Web App, Customer App, Admin Panel, and Rider App.

Introduction

Lumi is a next-generation super app based in Qatar. It is built on the Enatega framework and enhanced with proprietary AI extensions to create a unified ride-sharing and food delivery platform.

The Challenge

Lumi set out to address several market needs.

Service Fragmentation
Users in Qatar relied on multiple separate applications for transportation, food delivery, hospitality services, and travel. Lumi aimed to unify these services under one platform.

AI-Driven Personalisation
Traditional service apps in the region lacked intelligent recommendations and adaptive user experiences.

Multi-Service Architecture
Integrating ride sharing, delivery, and future travel services into a single scalable application required rethinking the base architecture.

Local Relevance and Language Support
Qatar’s diverse population required support for both Arabic and English within the same interface.

To meet these demands, Lumi needed a scalable solution that could adapt quickly without compromising performance or user experience.

Development Journey

Lumi’s development was based on the Enatega white-label super app platform, selected for its modular architecture and on-demand service foundation. The framework was extended with a new ride-sharing module that included driver onboarding, trip management, real-time tracking, and dynamic pricing logic.

Stage I: Architectural Enhancement

Artificial intelligence components were added to improve search relevance, tailor ride and food recommendations, and optimise routing for drivers and delivery partners.

Stage II: AI Features Integration

AI capabilities were embedded to enhance personalisation, predictive searches, and contextual service suggestions.

Stage III: Localisation and Language Support

The user interface was fully localised with support for both right-to-left (Arabic) and left-to-right (English) layouts. Cultural and regional preferences guided UI design decisions throughout this stage.

Stage IV: Scalable Modules for Future Services

Hotel booking, flight reservations, and hospitality services were architected as independent modules, allowing them to be enabled without affecting core ride or delivery services.

The development process followed an iterative approach with continuous user testing to validate usability and responsiveness across services.

Key Capabilities
Ride Sharing

Lumi offers fast rider-driver matching with transparent pricing and fare estimates. The experience includes options for tipping, discounts, and feedback, along with real-time tracking, trip updates, preferred language support, and local payment methods.

Food Delivery

The food delivery service includes a wide selection of partner restaurants, seamless ordering with live order tracking, smart recommendations influenced by user behaviour, and integrated maps with delivery ETA visibility.

AI-Powered Enhancements

AI-driven features include intelligent suggestions tailored to user preferences, predictive searches based on prior activity, and context-aware ride and food options.

Scalable Architecture

Lumi is built on a modular architecture designed for future expansion into hotel, flight, and hospitality services. The platform supports shared user accounts across services and a unified payment system.

Launch and Results

Lumi’s rollout focused on stabilising core services in major population centres across Qatar. Early adoption demonstrated strong user interest in combined services.

Key outcomes included rapid adoption with strong user retention, positive feedback on AI recommendations and interface simplicity, smooth onboarding of partner drivers and restaurants, and high engagement across both ride-sharing and food delivery services.

Future Service Expansion

Lumi is designed to extend into additional service areas.

Hotel Booking
Integration with global and regional hotel partners, supported by AI-based stay recommendations.

Flight Booking
Search and booking across airlines with fare predictions and smart alerts.

Hospitality Services
Concierge-level services including home cleaning, laundry, electrician, and other technical services.

Each new capability is designed to integrate naturally within the existing app experience.

Conclusion

Lumi represents a pioneering initiative within Qatar’s digital ecosystem. By combining ride sharing and food delivery with artificial intelligence and a flexible architectural foundation, it delivers a compelling multi-service experience. Built on the Enatega framework and enhanced with customised modules, Lumi is positioned to expand into travel and hospitality while setting a new standard for super apps in the region.
