slug: borku-delivery | chars: 3471

# Borku: Bringing African Cuisine To Food Delivery

## Introduction
Borku is an emerging food delivery app centered on African cuisine, developed on Enatega and customized by Ninjas Code. With a focus on cultural authenticity and user convenience, Borku aims to create a seamless experience for users craving African flavors. Although Borku remains a work in progress, this case study highlights the significant steps taken to establish a unique and culturally focused platform.

## The Vision: Showcasing African Cuisine
Borku was created to celebrate the diversity of African cuisine through a specialized food delivery platform. To achieve this, the team focused on a few key areas:

### Customized Menu Items
Borku required menu options that reflected various African cuisines, showcasing the rich culinary heritage across the continent.

### User-Friendly Interface
A UI and UX overhaul was needed to offer users an engaging, easy-to-navigate platform that embraced African-themed aesthetics.

### Streamlined Onboarding
To attract both riders and restaurants, Borku needed a simplified onboarding process with forms tailored to each group.

### Seamless Payment Integration
Stripe was integrated to enable smooth, secure transactions.

## Key Development Highlights

### Customizing The Menu For African Cuisine
To emphasize the diversity of African food, Borku’s team created unique menu options that cater to regional tastes. This customization allows restaurants to highlight popular dishes, from West African Jollof rice to North African tagines, providing users with a variety of options they won’t find on typical food delivery platforms.

### User Interface And Experience Overhaul
Given the goal of creating a culturally resonant and user-friendly platform, Borku received a comprehensive UI and UX revamp. The design incorporates vibrant, authentic African elements, making the app visually appealing while offering smooth navigation for users.

### Simplified Onboarding With Rider And Restaurant Forms
To encourage engagement with the platform, Borku introduced custom forms to help new riders and restaurants join the network. These forms collect essential information and guide each party through the onboarding process, making it easier for vendors and drivers to start operating on Borku.

### Secure And Convenient Stripe Payment Integration
For reliable and versatile payment handling, Borku integrated Stripe, providing users with a secure, familiar method for completing transactions. This setup also ensures that payments are processed quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Moving Forward With Borku
Borku’s journey is just beginning. With the foundational features now in place, the team is focusing on fine-tuning the user experience and exploring potential enhancements to expand Borku’s appeal. Future updates will continue to celebrate African cuisine, expanding options and improving usability.

## What’s Next For Borku?

# Configuration

## Google Maps API Keys

### Video Walkthrough

### Enatega Multivendor | Configuring Google Maps API Key Setup

1. Log in with your Google Account or establish an account at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. On the Google Cloud Console, create a project.
3. Activate the following APIs in your project:
   - Geocoding API
   - Maps Javascript API
   - Places API
   - Maps Elevation API
   - Maps Static API
   - Geolocation API
   - Distance Matrix API
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS

4. Set up the Google Billing account.

5. Go to API & Services > Credentials from the left menu and select “Create Credentials.”
6. Create a key called HTTP Key, and then add your website URL as follows under the website restrictions tab. If your website is my-domain.com, add these:
   - https://my-domain.com/*
   - https://www.my-domain.com/*

   Make sure to add an asterisk (*) at the end of the URL.

7. Create another key named IP Key and under the IP Addresses section, paste your website/server IP address.

### Very Important

The IP address of your website might not always be sufficient to configure the IP limited key in a shared hosting environment. A pop-up notification will appear, looking somewhat like this: 

"Geocoding failed because `This IP, site or mobile application is not authorized to use this API Key. Request received from IP address *.*.*.* with empty referer."

The *.*.*.* is your server’s IP address, which needs to be set on the IP Restricted key. Go back to the Google Cloud Console and set this IP Address provided in the popup.

Modifications should be made to all modules that require GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY or googleMapsAPIkey, and all modifications should be saved. It takes Google APIs 5 to 10 minutes to update your website.

# Easy Eats: For The Students, By The Students

## Introduction
Easy Eats is a campus and dormitory food delivery service developed by Ninjas Code and powered by Enatega. It is specifically designed for college students who want food delivered to their dorm rooms or within their college campuses. Easy Eats differentiates itself from other food delivery services like UberEats and Grubhub by employing only student drivers and offering more options tailored to college students, while also emphasizing student-focused features.

## Getting Started
Easy Eats began as a passion project by a group of college students aiming to simplify their peers' lives on campus. The founders entered the Greenlight Maine competition, which encourages entrepreneurs and innovators from various industries, including college students, to present their ideas for funding and support. Prior to this, Easy Eats collaborated with the Ninjas Code team to develop a solution that catered specifically to college students while incorporating features commonly found in competing services. They sought an app that would attract early investors and provide a unique user experience. The customizability of the Enatega solution facilitated the development of an ideal college food delivery app, despite encountering typical software development challenges.

## The Development Journey
The Easy Eats team outlined the necessary features and customizations for their unique food delivery application. Following standard development practices, Ninjas Code gathered the Easy Eats team's requirements and established a step-by-step implementation process. A clear roadmap was created to keep development on track and provide a vision of the project's expected timelines.

### Designing A User-Friendly UI/UX
The Ninjas Code team prioritized creating a clean and user-friendly experience for college students who would use the app to order and deliver food. The design team crafted a sleek and intuitive user interface that aligned with the Easy Eats brand. With an easy onboarding flow and a modern user experience, the team successfully brought Easy Eats' vision to life.

### Student-Focused Features
Given that the primary audience for Easy Eats was college students, the features were tailored to their needs. A significant feature was the ability to order food directly to dorm rooms, including options for group ordering to accommodate students sharing dorms with roommates.

### Student Driver Onboarding
All riders for the Easy Eats app are fellow students, which is essential for ensuring quick deliveries to dorm rooms. Student drivers are familiar with the college's locations, allowing them to deliver orders directly without getting lost. The Ninjas Code team ensured that the rider onboarding process was straightforward, enabling Easy Eats to onboard as many riders as possible quickly.

### Automatic Payment For Riders And Restaurants
The development team implemented a wallet feature for riders and restaurants, automating the payment process while ensuring accessibility. Both restaurants and riders can transfer funds to their accounts directly from their wallets almost immediately whenever they choose.

## Launching The App
Once all requested features for version 1.0 were completed, the app was ready for launch. The Easy Eats founders participated in the Greenlight Maine competition, where they presented their app to the judges. After showcasing the app's unique features, the Easy Eats team won the competition, receiving $25,000 to expand their operations. Subsequently, they launched the app at their college in Maine and expanded to other nearby universities.

# Enatega Platform Documentation

## High-Level Architecture

### How Everything Comes Together
The high-level architecture of the Enatega platform is designed for seamless interaction between various components.

### Our High-Level Architecture At A Glance
The user’s mobile application provides access to both the API Server and the Amplitude analytics dashboard. Meanwhile, the web dashboard exclusively communicates with the API Server. 

The platform features dedicated apps for different stakeholders: the Rider App and the Restaurant App, both of which interface directly with the API Server. Additionally, a comprehensive error reporting mechanism is in place, with the Customer App, Restaurant App, Rider App, Web Customer App, and the API Server itself all configured to report issues to Sentry, ensuring robust monitoring and quick resolution of any problems.

### User Roles
- **Vendors**: Create accounts and register restaurants on the system using the Admin Dashboard. They can manage orders, menus, and profiles.
- **Customers**: Use the mobile/web app to browse restaurant menus, place food orders, and track delivery status.
- **Restaurants**: Receive and prepare orders made through the platform. They can view orders and update statuses.
- **Riders**: Are notified of new delivery requests. They can pick up food from restaurants and drop it off to customers, updating statuses through the Rider App.
- **API**: Acts as the backend, facilitating communication between all parties and storing/retrieving data in the MongoDB database.

slug: how-to-deploy-admin-dashboard | chars: 3110

# How To Deploy Admin Dashboard

## Enatega Multivendor | Admin Web Deployment

Initially, we must launch the admin panel and store all the keys using the administrative interface.

### Clone or Download Source Code from GitHub

To download Admin Dashboard, click here on Download Admin Dashboard. Node.js must be set up on your computer to run the module. The following commands should be entered in the directory after Node.js has been installed:

```bash
cd <Project directory> 
# e.g. cd enatega-multivendor-admin
```

### Change constants.js File

You need to change the following credentials in the constants.js file. To change the constants.js file, go to the `src` folder, then go to the `config` folder, where you will find `constants.js`.

You are required to incorporate the following values into this file:

- `value#1` (SERVER_URL)
- `value#2` (WS_SERVER_URL)
- `value#3` (GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY)

Subsequently, all other values will be retrieved from the database once saved through the configuration in the admin panel. Initially, if the values are not yet available from the configuration (database), please hardcode them into the `constants.js` file.

The configuration provided below is where you should append the values after executing the admin panel. These values are utilized across the entire project, including mobile apps, the web, and the admin interface.

In the admin panel under the configuration, you need to add all the values. As we have numbered each variable in the `constants.js` file, the explanation against each number is provided below:

- **REACT_APP_SERVER_URL**: This variable specifies the base URL of your backend server that the web application will communicate with. It’s essential for making API requests to your server.
  
- **REACT_APP_WS_SERVER_URL**: This variable defines the WebSocket server URL. WebSockets are used for real-time communication, and this URL is crucial for establishing WebSocket connections with your server.

### What is SERVER_URL?

This variable specifies the base URL of your server. It’s the root URL where your backend API is hosted.

### So What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. A backend API is responsible for handling data and requests on the server-side of a software application. The backend code of this project is the API for this project.

To make your API accessible to the internet, you need a hosting service. A hosting service provides the infrastructure and resources to run your server, making it available 24/7. Hosting services can be cloud platforms (like Heroku, AWS, or Digital Ocean) or specialized services like Railway Cloud.

# How to Deploy to Backend API?

Deploying means making your API server available and functional on the hosting service. This typically involves uploading your code, configuring the server, and ensuring it’s up and running. Here is how you can deploy your API server and get the SERVER_URL for adding in the .env file.

# How to Deploy a React Application?

To deploy these applications, you can use hosting platforms like Netlify and Vercel, which specialize in hosting web applications. These platforms provide an easy and streamlined deployment process. One of the simplest is to use Netlify. By looking through this documentation, you can browse through its user manual.

## Deployment Steps

### Netlify

For Netlify, you would typically connect your code repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab) to your Netlify account. Specify the build settings and configurations for your dashboard and web app. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your applications when you push changes to your repository. You can set custom domains or subdomains for your applications, which will become the URLs for your dashboard and web app.

### Vercel

Vercel offers a similar process. You connect your code repository, configure your settings, and Vercel handles the build and deployment. Custom domains can be set up on Vercel to determine the URLs for your dashboard and web app.

url: https://enatega.com/overview-of-the-api/ | title: Overview of the API - Multi-Vendor Doc - Enatega
slug: overview-of-the-api | chars: 1620

# Getting Started Overview of the API

## About Our API

Enatega’s API follows a monolithic architecture, which means that the entire software application is developed as a single, unified codebase. Consequently, any modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications. Enatega uses the Express JS framework and GraphQL for building the API. You can view the full GraphQL diagram below:

### Resolvers

In GraphQL, Resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema. When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.

### Dockerization

Dockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

### Database

Enatega uses MongoDB to manage its database instead of SQL for database management. You can view MongoDB’s documentation by clicking here.

# Enatega's Technical Architecture for Food Delivery Solutions

Enatega employs a sophisticated and modern technical architecture designed to deliver comprehensive food delivery solutions that compete with major platforms such as UberEats, DoorDash, and Foodpanda.

## Customizable Food Delivery Application

Enatega provides a fully realized and customizable food delivery application that enables users to create their own order and delivery management systems. This application features an open-source frontend, complemented by proprietary backend APIs available through paid licensing.

# Enatega Development Setup and Deployment Guide

## 1. Initial Development Environment Setup

### 1.1 Node.js and NVM Installation

Ensure Brew is installed on Mac OS by checking the version using `Brew -V`. Use Brew to install NVM (Node Version Manager) with the command `Brew install NVM` and verify installation with `NVM -V`. Install the recommended Node.js version 18.20.4 or any version beyond 18 using `NVM install 18.20.4`.

Use `NVM LS` to list all installed Node.js versions. If multiple versions exist, set the required version as default using `NVM alias default 18.20.4`. The default version will be highlighted in green in the list. Confirm Node.js is working properly by running `Node -V` and executing any simple JavaScript code snippet to verify functionality.

### 1.2 Git and SSH Configuration

Install Git using Brew via the command `Brew install Git` and verify the installation by checking the version with `Git -V`, which should show a version like 2.39 or higher. Generate a new SSH key by following standard git ssh configuration procedures found through a Google search.

During SSH key generation, use an appropriate email address and accept the default path by pressing enter. Enter and reconfirm a passphrase that must be remembered, as it will be required for authentication during project cloning operations.

Start the SSH agent and add the newly generated key to it. Change the directory to `~/.SSH` and create an empty configuration file using the `touch config` command. Open the configuration file with a text editor and paste the SSH configuration from the standard setup article, ensuring the key ID or name is correct to avoid conflicts.

Copy the public key to the clipboard using the command provided in the standard git ssh configuration article. Navigate to your GitHub profile settings, select "SSH and GPG keys", and click "New SSH key". Give the key a meaningful title and select "Authentication Key" from the key type dropdown. Paste the copied public key and click "Add", then confirm by typing your GitHub account password.

### 1.3 Project Cloning

Clone the proprietary Enatega backend API project from GitHub using the SSH link. The cloning process may ask for the passphrase created during SSH key generation. Once cloned, open the project in VS Code using the command `code .`.

## 2. Backend Setup: Backend API

### 2.1 Environment Variables Configuration

Create a new `.env` file in the backend project directory. Paste all required environment variables into this file, including connection string, server URL, backend URL, dashboard URL, and web URL. Ensure the Server URL uses the correct private IP address of your system for proper local network connectivity.

### 2.2 MongoDB Setup and Configuration

Sign in to MongoDB Atlas and create an account if you don't have one. Configure Network Access settings for your cluster. For testing purposes, allow access from any IP address using `0.0.0.0/0`, though this configuration is not recommended for production environments.

## 2. Backend Setup: Backend API

### 2.1 Environment Variables Configuration

Create a new `.env` file in the backend project directory. Paste all required environment variables into this file, including connection string, server URL, backend URL, dashboard URL, and web URL. Ensure the Server URL uses the correct private IP address of your system for proper local network connectivity.

### 2.2 MongoDB Setup and Configuration

Sign in to MongoDB Atlas and create an account if you don't have one. Configure Network Access settings for your cluster. For testing purposes, allow access from any IP address using `0.0.0.0/0`, though this configuration is not recommended for production environments.

Create a database user such as `enatega_test_user` and assign it a password. Assign the user an Admin role or the required role for your configuration. Use the default free cluster named Cluster 0 for your setup. Create a new database with a name like `enatega_test_user` and create a default collection named `user`.

Navigate to the cluster overview and click "Connect". Select "MongoDB for VS Code" to obtain the default connection string. Copy the connection string and update the password field by removing the brackets and inserting your actual password. Update the database name in the connection string to match your created database.

Paste the final valid connection string into the `CONNECTION_STRING` variable in the backend's `.env` file. Optionally, connect to the database using a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass to verify the connection works correctly.

### 2.3 Firebase Service Account Setup

Navigate to the Firebase console and create a new project for your application. Go to Project Settings and select Service Accounts. Choose Node.js as your environment and click "Generate new private key" to download the service account key file.

Open the downloaded service account key file, which contains sensitive authentication information. Copy the entire contents of this JSON file and paste it into the `serviceAccountKey.json` file located in the Enatega API project directory. Ensure this file is never pushed to any public repository as it contains confidential credentials.

### 2.4 Redis Configuration

Add three environment variables to the `.env` file for Redis configuration: Host, Password, and Port. These credentials are configured in the `docker-compose.yaml` file. The container name such as `redis` is used as the host value. The default Redis port is `6379`. The password can be set to `null` if no password is configured for your Redis instance.

### 2.5 Install Dependencies and Start Server

Run `npm install` or `npm i` in the VS Code terminal to install all required packages for the backend. Execute the start command from package.json using `npm run start` to start the backend server.
