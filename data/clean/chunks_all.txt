slug: borku-delivery | chars: 3471

# Borku: Bringing African Cuisine To Food Delivery

## Introduction
Borku is an emerging food delivery app centered on African cuisine, developed on Enatega and customized by Ninjas Code. With a focus on cultural authenticity and user convenience, Borku aims to create a seamless experience for users craving African flavors. Although Borku remains a work in progress, this case study highlights the significant steps taken to establish a unique and culturally focused platform.

## The Vision: Showcasing African Cuisine
Borku was created to celebrate the diversity of African cuisine through a specialized food delivery platform. To achieve this, the team focused on a few key areas:

### Customized Menu Items
Borku required menu options that reflected various African cuisines, showcasing the rich culinary heritage across the continent.

### User-Friendly Interface
A UI and UX overhaul was needed to offer users an engaging, easy-to-navigate platform that embraced African-themed aesthetics.

### Streamlined Onboarding
To attract both riders and restaurants, Borku needed a simplified onboarding process with forms tailored to each group.

### Seamless Payment Integration
Stripe was integrated to enable smooth, secure transactions.

## Key Development Highlights

### Customizing The Menu For African Cuisine
To emphasize the diversity of African food, Borku’s team created unique menu options that cater to regional tastes. This customization allows restaurants to highlight popular dishes, from West African Jollof rice to North African tagines, providing users with a variety of options they won’t find on typical food delivery platforms.

### User Interface And Experience Overhaul
Given the goal of creating a culturally resonant and user-friendly platform, Borku received a comprehensive UI and UX revamp. The design incorporates vibrant, authentic African elements, making the app visually appealing while offering smooth navigation for users.

### Simplified Onboarding With Rider And Restaurant Forms
To encourage engagement with the platform, Borku introduced custom forms to help new riders and restaurants join the network. These forms collect essential information and guide each party through the onboarding process, making it easier for vendors and drivers to start operating on Borku.

### Secure And Convenient Stripe Payment Integration
For reliable and versatile payment handling, Borku integrated Stripe, providing users with a secure, familiar method for completing transactions. This setup also ensures that payments are processed quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Moving Forward With Borku
Borku’s journey is just beginning. With the foundational features now in place, the team is focusing on fine-tuning the user experience and exploring potential enhancements to expand Borku’s appeal. Future updates will continue to celebrate African cuisine, expanding options and improving usability.

## What’s Next For Borku?
Borku’s commitment to cultural authenticity and convenience reflects the versatility of Enatega’s platform and the creative expertise of Ninjas Code. By catering to African cuisine enthusiasts with a customized menu, engaging UI, and user-friendly features, Borku is poised to make a meaningful impact in the food delivery market as development progresses.

### Enatega Multivendor | Configuring Google Maps API Key Setup

1. Log in with your Google Account or establish an account at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. On the Google Cloud Console, create a project.
3. Activate the following APIs in your project:
   - Geocoding API
   - Maps Javascript API
   - Places API
   - Maps Elevation API
   - Maps Static API
   - Geolocation API
   - Distance Matrix API
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS

4. Set up the Google Billing account.

5. Go to API & Services > Credentials from the left menu and select “Create Credentials.”
6. Create a key called HTTP Key, and then add your website URL as follows under the website restrictions tab. If your website is my-domain.com, add these:
   - https://my-domain.com/*
   - https://www.my-domain.com/*

   Make sure to add an asterisk (*) at the end of the URL.

7. Create another key named IP Key and under the IP Addresses section, paste your website/server IP address.

### Very Important

The IP address of your website might not always be sufficient to configure the IP limited key in a shared hosting environment. A pop-up notification will appear, looking somewhat like this: 

"Geocoding failed because `This IP, site or mobile application is not authorized to use this API Key. Request received from IP address *.*.*.* with empty referer."

The *.*.*.* is your server’s IP address, which needs to be set on the IP Restricted key. Go back to the Google Cloud Console and set this IP Address provided in the popup.

Modifications should be made to all modules that require GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY or googleMapsAPIkey, and all modifications should be saved. It takes Google APIs 5 to 10 minutes to update your website.

# Easy Eats: For The Students, By The Students

## Introduction
Easy Eats is a campus and dormitory food delivery service developed by Ninjas Code and powered by Enatega. It is specifically designed for college students who want food delivered to their dorm rooms or within their college campuses. Easy Eats differentiates itself from other food delivery services like UberEats and Grubhub by employing only student drivers and offering more options tailored to college students, while also emphasizing student-focused features.

## Getting Started
Easy Eats began as a passion project by a group of college students aiming to simplify their peers' lives on campus. The founders entered the Greenlight Maine competition, which encourages entrepreneurs and innovators from various industries, including college students, to present their ideas for funding and support. Prior to this, Easy Eats collaborated with the Ninjas Code team to develop a solution that catered specifically to college students while incorporating features commonly found in competing services. They sought an app that would attract early investors and provide a unique user experience. The customizability of the Enatega solution facilitated the development of an ideal college food delivery app, despite encountering typical software development challenges.

## The Development Journey
The Easy Eats team outlined the necessary features and customizations for their unique food delivery application. Following standard development practices, Ninjas Code gathered the Easy Eats team's requirements and established a step-by-step implementation process. A clear roadmap was created to keep development on track and provide a vision of the project's expected timelines.

### Designing A User-Friendly UI/UX
The Ninjas Code team prioritized creating a clean and user-friendly experience for college students who would use the app to order and deliver food. The design team crafted a sleek and intuitive user interface that aligned with the Easy Eats brand. With an easy onboarding flow and a modern user experience, the team successfully brought Easy Eats' vision to life.

### Student-Focused Features
Given that the primary audience for Easy Eats was college students, the features were tailored to their needs. A significant feature was the ability to order food directly to dorm rooms, including options for group ordering to accommodate students sharing dorms with roommates.

### Student Driver Onboarding
All riders for the Easy Eats app are fellow students, which is essential for ensuring quick deliveries to dorm rooms. Student drivers are familiar with the college's locations, allowing them to deliver orders directly without getting lost. The Ninjas Code team ensured that the rider onboarding process was straightforward, enabling Easy Eats to onboard as many riders as possible quickly.

### Automatic Payment For Riders And Restaurants
The development team implemented a wallet feature for riders and restaurants, automating the payment process while ensuring accessibility. Both restaurants and riders can transfer funds to their accounts directly from their wallets almost immediately whenever they choose.

## Launching The App
Once all requested features for version 1.0 were completed, the app was ready for launch. The Easy Eats founders participated in the Greenlight Maine competition, where they presented their app to the judges. After showcasing the app's unique features, the Easy Eats team won the competition, receiving $25,000 to expand their operations. Subsequently, they launched the app at their college in Maine and expanded to other nearby universities.

## High-Level Architecture

### How Everything Comes Together
The high-level architecture of the Enatega platform is designed for seamless interaction between various components.

### Our High-Level Architecture At A Glance
The user’s mobile application provides access to both the API Server and the Amplitude analytics dashboard. Meanwhile, the web dashboard exclusively communicates with the API Server. 

The platform features dedicated apps for different stakeholders: the Rider App and the Restaurant App, both of which interface directly with the API Server. Additionally, a comprehensive error reporting mechanism is in place, with the Customer App, Restaurant App, Rider App, Web Customer App, and the API Server itself all configured to report issues to Sentry, ensuring robust monitoring and quick resolution of any problems.

### User Roles
- **Vendors**: Create accounts and register restaurants on the system using the Admin Dashboard. They can manage orders, menus, and profiles.
- **Customers**: Use the mobile/web app to browse restaurant menus, place food orders, and track delivery status.
- **Restaurants**: Receive and prepare orders made through the platform. They can view orders and update statuses.
- **Riders**: Are notified of new delivery requests. They can pick up food from restaurants and drop it off to customers, updating statuses through the Rider App.
- **API**: Acts as the backend, facilitating communication between all parties and storing/retrieving data in the MongoDB database.

# How To Deploy Admin Dashboard

## Enatega Multivendor | Admin Web Deployment

Initially, we must launch the admin panel and store all the keys using the administrative interface.

### Clone or Download Source Code from GitHub

To download Admin Dashboard, click here on Download Admin Dashboard. Node.js must be set up on your computer to run the module. The following commands should be entered in the directory after Node.js has been installed:

```bash
cd <Project directory> 
# e.g. cd enatega-multivendor-admin
```

### Change constants.js File

You need to change the following credentials in the constants.js file. To change the constants.js file, go to the `src` folder, then go to the `config` folder, where you will find `constants.js`.

You are required to incorporate the following values into this file:

- `value#1` (SERVER_URL)
- `value#2` (WS_SERVER_URL)
- `value#3` (GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY)

Subsequently, all other values will be retrieved from the database once saved through the configuration in the admin panel. Initially, if the values are not yet available from the configuration (database), please hardcode them into the `constants.js` file.

The configuration provided below is where you should append the values after executing the admin panel. These values are utilized across the entire project, including mobile apps, the web, and the admin interface.

In the admin panel under the configuration, you need to add all the values. As we have numbered each variable in the `constants.js` file, the explanation against each number is provided below:

- **REACT_APP_SERVER_URL**: This variable specifies the base URL of your backend server that the web application will communicate with. It’s essential for making API requests to your server.
  
- **REACT_APP_WS_SERVER_URL**: This variable defines the WebSocket server URL. WebSockets are used for real-time communication, and this URL is crucial for establishing WebSocket connections with your server.

### What is SERVER_URL?

This variable specifies the base URL of your server. It’s the root URL where your backend API is hosted.

### So What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. A backend API is responsible for handling data and requests on the server-side of a software application. The backend code of this project is the API for this project.

# How to Deploy a React Application?

To deploy these applications, you can use hosting platforms like Netlify and Vercel, which specialize in hosting web applications. These platforms provide an easy and streamlined deployment process. One of the simplest is to use Netlify. By looking through this documentation, you can browse through its user manual.

## Deployment Steps

### Netlify

For Netlify, you would typically connect your code repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab) to your Netlify account. Specify the build settings and configurations for your dashboard and web app. Netlify will automatically build and deploy your applications when you push changes to your repository. You can set custom domains or subdomains for your applications, which will become the URLs for your dashboard and web app.

### Vercel

Vercel offers a similar process. You connect your code repository, configure your settings, and Vercel handles the build and deployment. Custom domains can be set up on Vercel to determine the URLs for your dashboard and web app.

#### Step 2: Environment Variables
After setting up Docker, you’ll need to configure the environment variables. Follow these steps to modify or create the .env file with your credentials:  
⚠ Note: If you do not find a .env file, create one in the root directory and paste the following contents into the .env file.

**Contents Of .Env File:**
```
PORT=8001
CONNECTION_STRING=
RESET_PASSWORD_LINK=auth/reset/?reset=
SERVER_URL=https://enatega-multivendor.up.railway.app/
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET=
DASHBOARD_URL=https://practical-minsky-95a652.netlify.app/#/
WEB_URL=https://pensive-liskov-5320d4.netlify.app/
ORDER_DETAIL_WEB_URL=order-detail/
NODE_DEV=production
NODE_ENV=production
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
```

### Environment Variables Explanation:
Make sure to understand the purpose of each environment variable before modifying them.

- **PORT:** The port number on which the server will run.
- **CONNECTION_STRING:** This variable contains the connection string for your MongoDB database. It includes the username and password needed to connect to the database, as well as the cluster URL and some connection options.
- **RESET_PASSWORD_LINK:** Link for resetting passwords.
- **SERVER_URL:** This variable specifies the base URL of your server. It’s the root URL where your backend API is hosted.
- **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET:** This variable is used for Stripe webhook verification. It’s a secret key that Stripe uses to sign webhook events, ensuring their authenticity.
- **DASHBOARD_URL:** URL for the dashboard.
- **WEB_URL:** URL for the web application.
- **ORDER_DETAIL_WEB_URL:** This variable might be a partial URL used to construct links to specific order details in your application.
- **NODE_DEV:** Node development environment.
- **NODE_ENV:** Node environment.
- **SENDGRID_API_KEY:** Please enter your SendGrid API key if you intend to use SendGrid for sending emails; otherwise, leave this field empty.

#### Step 3: Adding ServiceAccountKey.Json
Lastly, you need to add your own serviceAccountKey.json. This file is typically used for Firebase Admin SDK. Follow these steps to obtain and add the file:
1. Go to the Firebase Console.
2. Select your project.
3. Navigate to Project Settings > Service accounts.
4. Click on “Generate new private key” to download the JSON file.
5. Replace the downloaded serviceAccountKey.json file in the project directory.

# Getting Started Overview of the API

## About Our API

Enatega’s API follows a monolithic architecture, which means that the entire software application is developed as a single, unified codebase. Consequently, any modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications. Enatega uses the Express JS framework and GraphQL for building the API. You can view the full GraphQL diagram below:

### Resolvers

In GraphQL, Resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema. When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.

### Dockerization

Dockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

### Database

Enatega uses MongoDB to manage its database instead of SQL for database management. You can view MongoDB’s documentation by clicking here.

# Snap Delivered: Disrupting The Food Delivery Industry

## Overview
Eliminate the surprise delivery fee and order meals from your favorite restaurants in no time! 

### What Is Snap Delivered?
Snap Delivered is a food delivery platform powered by Enatega, similar to other big-name companies like Foodpanda and UberEats. Snap Delivered began its operations in 2019 with one big goal in mind: to disrupt the food delivery industry and challenge the standards and precedents already set by the industry leaders. These standards include aspects such as rider compensation and delivery charges for business owners. Snap Delivered provided an easy and transparent way to handle deliveries by charging business owners a set rate of only $2 per delivery. This flat rate not only allowed new business owners to use a service like Snap Delivered to automate deliveries but also helped level the playing field for restaurants of all sizes.

## Challenges Faced By Snap Delivered

### Highly Competitive Landscape
The food delivery industry is highly competitive, with established players like UberEats, Grubhub, and DoorDash dominating the market. Snap Delivered had to contend with these giants, making it challenging to gain significant market share.

### The Marketplace Dilemma
Attracting both customers and restaurants to the platform proved to be a daunting task. Convincing users to switch from their existing preferences and habits with other platforms required substantial marketing efforts. Moreover, retaining both sides of the marketplace posed an ongoing challenge.

### Rider Management
Managing a vast network of delivery riders and ensuring timely and accurate deliveries is a complex operational challenge. Snap Delivered had to invest in the latest and most reliable logistics and coordination systems to maintain efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### Profitability
Offering a flat rate of $2 per delivery to business owners was a bold move, but it also put pressure on Snap Delivered’s profitability. Balancing the need to attract businesses with affordable rates while maintaining a sustainable business model proved to be a delicate balancing act. This created a need for a safe and convenient alternative to traditional delivery options, which is where Snap Delivered came in.

## Overcoming The Challenges

### Built Strategic Partnerships
Snap Delivered forged strategic partnerships with local restaurants, offering them a unique value proposition. By collaborating closely with small and medium-sized businesses, Snap Delivered differentiated itself from larger competitors and created a more inclusive platform.

### Introduced Customer Incentives
To address user acquisition and retention challenges, Snap Delivered implemented customer incentives and loyalty programs. Discounts, exclusive deals, and a user-friendly rewards system helped attract and retain both individual customers and restaurants.

### Invested In Platform Upgrades
Recognizing the importance of technology in the industry, Snap Delivered continually invested in upgrading its platform. This included improving the user experience, optimizing delivery routes, and implementing advanced data analytics to enhance operational efficiency.

### Initiated Referral Programs
While maintaining an affordable flat rate, Snap Delivered introduced referral programs allowing anyone to increase their income. The various options provided to individuals as well as businesses meant that anyone involved with Snap Delivered could earn money via recruitment, word-of-mouth advertisement, or referrals.

Regular feedback sessions with the Snap team ensured that the project stayed on track and aligned with the initial vision.

# Enatega's Technical Architecture for Food Delivery Solutions

Enatega employs a sophisticated and modern technical architecture designed to deliver comprehensive food delivery solutions that compete with major platforms such as UberEats, DoorDash, and Foodpanda.

## Customizable Food Delivery Application

Enatega provides a fully realized and customizable food delivery application that enables users to create their own order and delivery management systems. This application features an open-source frontend, complemented by proprietary backend APIs available through paid licensing.

## Backend Infrastructure

The platform's technical foundation is built on Node.js and Express.js. This backend infrastructure supports high-performance server-side operations, allowing for the handling of multiple concurrent orders, real-time tracking, and complex restaurant management workflows essential for food delivery platforms.

## Frontend Ecosystem

The frontend ecosystem utilizes React.js to develop responsive web-based admin dashboards. These dashboards enable restaurant owners and platform administrators to manage orders, menus, and analytics. Additionally, React Native powers cross-platform mobile applications, which include dedicated apps for customers to browse and order food, delivery riders to manage their routes and pickups, and restaurant owners to process incoming orders and update their menus.

## Enhanced Web Presence

Next.js is employed to enhance the platform's web presence through server-side rendering capabilities. This improvement boosts SEO performance and loading speeds for restaurant discovery pages and marketing websites.

## Data Query Language

GraphQL serves as the data query language, facilitating efficient API communication among all components of the multi-vendor food delivery ecosystem. This allows for precise data fetching for real-time order updates, location tracking, and restaurant inventory management.

## Comprehensive Food Delivery Solutions

Enatega's technology stack enables the delivery of complete food delivery solutions. Customers can browse restaurants, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time, while restaurant owners manage their menus and orders. Delivery riders can efficiently complete their routes using GPS integration.

## Scalability and White-Label Solution

The architecture maintains the scalability necessary to support multiple restaurants and thousands of concurrent users across various geographic locations. This makes it an ideal white-label solution for entrepreneurs and established businesses looking to launch their own branded food delivery platforms without incurring the substantial development costs typically associated with building such complex systems from scratch.

# Yalla: Redefining Food And Grocery Delivery Across The Region

Yalla is a dynamic food and grocery delivery app built on Enatega, offering a seamless bilingual experience. Designed for growth, it delivers fast, intuitive service across the regional market.

## Overview

Yalla is a powerful, all-in-one food and grocery delivery app built on top of the Enatega platform. Designed to meet the fast-paced demands of a growing customer base, Yalla combines intuitive design with modern features to offer a world-class delivery experience in both Arabic and English. 

From concept to launch, this case study highlights how Yalla became a standout player in the regional market and how it continues to grow.

## The Challenges Faced By Yalla

Yalla set out to solve a common frustration in the delivery space: juggling multiple apps for different needs. The goal was to build a single platform that supports:

1. **Multifunctional Deliveries**: Combining food, grocery, and retail orders into one seamless app.
2. **Multi-language Accessibility**: With a focus on Arabic and English to serve diverse communities.
3. **Feature-Rich Functionality**: Standing out in a market dominated by giants like Wolt and Haat.
4. **Localized Payments**: Offering region-specific payment gateways that match local expectations.

To bring this ambitious vision to life, Yalla needed a flexible, scalable solution—and a partner that could deliver quickly without compromising quality.

## The Development Journey

Using Enatega’s white-label framework as a foundation, the Enatega team customized the platform to support more than just food delivery. This included:

- Grocery and retail integration.
- Vendor-side tools for managing complex inventories.
- Support for regional fulfillment models across diverse store types.

This gave Yalla an edge from day one, as it could serve both restaurants and supermarkets with a unified user experience.

### PHASE I: Adapting Enatega for Multifunctional Delivery

Localization was critical. The UI was designed to support both right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) languages, enabling seamless toggling between Arabic and English. Every interface element—from navigation to product listings—was carefully translated and culturally adapted.

### PHASE II: Building a Multi-Language, User-Centric Interface

To stand out in a saturated space, Yalla introduced:

- Real-time, interactive map views for browsing local vendors.
- Smart search filters for cuisine, price, availability, and dietary needs.
- Personalized recommendations based on user behavior and trends.
- Category-based menus for groceries, food, and essentials.

### PHASE III: Developing Market-Leading Features

Yalla needed flexible, regionally compliant payment solutions. The Enatega team integrated a local payment provider (HYP). This addition allowed customers to use their credit and debit cards to pay for orders.

### PHASE IV: Payment Gateway Customization

## Launch & Results

With a laser-focused agile approach, Yalla’s MVP was launched within just a few months. The results were immediate and impressive:

- 60,000+ active monthly users.
- 50+ operational restaurants and vendors onboarded.
- Growing engagement with daily order volume increasing steadily.
- Positive reviews citing UI simplicity and multi-functionality.
