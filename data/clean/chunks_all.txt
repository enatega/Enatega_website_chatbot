Easy Eats Case Study: Campus Food Delivery Platform
Project Overview
Basic Information
Easy Eats is a campus and dormitory food delivery service developed by Ninjas Code and powered by Enatega. The platform is specifically designed for college students who want food delivered to their dorm rooms or within their college campuses. Easy Eats differentiates itself from other food delivery services like UberEats and Grubhub by focusing exclusively on employing student drivers.
Unique Value Proposition
The platform stands out by having more options available for college students than they would normally get on other similar services. Easy Eats emphasizes student-focused features that cater specifically to the campus lifestyle and student needs.
Project Origins and Development
Initial Concept
Easy Eats started as a passion project by a few college students looking to make their fellow academics' lives easier on campus. The pioneers of the project began by entering the Greenlight Maine competition, which focuses on entrepreneurs and innovators from all industries while encouraging college students to present their ideas for funding and startup support.
Partnership with Ninjas Code
Before entering the competition, Easy Eats reached out to the Ninjas Code team to help set up a solution that would cater to college students while providing all the features that competitors have in the same space. They needed an app that would get early investors interested while providing a unique user experience that couldn't be found in competing apps.
Platform Customization Benefits
Thanks to the customizability of the Enatega solution, the process of building the perfect college food delivery app was made significantly smoother. The development team acknowledged that there were still hurdles along the way, as is standard with any software development process.
Development Journey
Requirements Gathering Process
The Easy Eats team laid out the features and customizations needed for their unique food delivery application. As is standard with any development process, Ninjas Code began by gathering the requirements of the Easy Eats team and created a step-by-step process for implementing the required features.
Project Planning and Roadmap
A clear roadmap was created to keep the development on track and provide a clear vision of the timelines that the project was expected to follow. This structured approach ensured systematic progress through the development phases.
Key Development Areas
User Interface and User Experience Design
The first focus area for the Ninjas Code team was creating a clean and user-friendly user experience for college students who would be both using the app to order food and delivering it themselves. The design team from Ninjas Code crafted a sleek and intuitive user interface that aligned with the Easy Eats brand. The result was an easy user onboarding flow and modern user experience that brought Easy Eats' vision to life.
Student-Focused Features Development
Since the target audience for Easy Eats was mainly college students, the features had to be focused around their specific needs. The primary feature was the ability to order food directly to dorm rooms with friends. Group ordering was added to the app to cater to college students sharing their dorm rooms with one or more fellow dorm mates.
Student Driver Onboarding System

Student-Focused Features Development
Since the target audience for Easy Eats was mainly college students, the features had to be focused around their specific needs. The primary feature was the ability to order food directly to dorm rooms with friends. Group ordering was added to the app to cater to college students sharing their dorm rooms with one or more fellow dorm mates.
Student Driver Onboarding System
The riders for the Easy Eats app were all going to be other students. This was crucial for making quick deliveries directly to dorm rooms, as student drivers were expected to be knowledgeable about the college's locations and could deliver orders directly to dorm rooms without getting lost. The Ninjas Code team ensured that the rider onboarding process for students was easy and straightforward so that Easy Eats could onboard as many riders as quickly as possible.
Automated Payment System
The development team added a wallet feature for riders and restaurants to make the payment function automated while being easily accessible. Both restaurants and riders could get their funds transferred to their accounts directly from their wallets almost immediately whenever they wanted.
Launch and Competition Success
App Launch Preparation
Once all requested features for version 1.0 were ready, the app was prepared for launch. The Easy Eats pioneers joined the Greenlight Maine competition and presented their app to the judges.
Competition Results
After presenting all of their app's unique features, the Easy Eats team won the competition along with $25,000, which went into expanding their operations. This funding provided the capital needed for business growth and expansion.
Market Expansion
Following the competition success, they launched the app across their own college in Maine and expanded operations to other surrounding universities as well. This phased expansion approach allowed them to test and refine their service before broader rollout.
Project Impact and Outcomes
Market Positioning
Easy Eats is a prime example of how a focused, community-driven approach can create a successful and impactful service. By understanding and addressing the unique needs of college students and making the most of their strategic partnerships, Easy Eats has carved out a niche in the local food delivery market.
Success Factors
The journey from a passion project to a thriving business demonstrates what a good idea and steely determination can help achieve. The combination of student-focused features, strategic partnerships, and targeted market approach contributed to the platform's success.
Technical Implementation Highlights
Platform Customization
The Easy Eats case demonstrates the flexibility and customizability of the Enatega platform for specialized markets. The ability to adapt the core platform for specific user needs while maintaining all standard delivery service features proved crucial for the project's success.
Student-Centric Features
Key technical implementations included group ordering functionality, student-specific onboarding processes, dorm room delivery optimization, and automated payment systems tailored for the student market segment.
User Experience Design
The development team successfully created an interface that appealed to college students while maintaining professional functionality. The balance between modern design and practical usability proved essential for user adoption.

**Go To Website**

---

## What is Snap Delivered?

Snap Delivered is a food delivery platform powered by Enatega, similar to companies like Foodpanda and UberEats.  

Founded in 2019, Snap Delivered aimed to **disrupt the food delivery industry** by challenging existing standards, including:

- How much riders get paid  
- How much business owners are charged per delivery

It offered a **flat $2 per delivery** model for business owners.  
This transparent pricing:

- Enabled new restaurants to join easily  
- Automated their delivery operations  
- Leveled the playing field for small and large restaurants alike

---

## Challenges Faced by Snap Delivered

Despite its innovative approach, Snap Delivered faced several challenges:

### Highly Competitive Landscape
Competing against industry giants like UberEats, Grubhub, and DoorDash made market penetration difficult.

### The Marketplace Dilemma
Attracting both customers and restaurants required heavy marketing and incentives.  
Convincing users to switch from existing platforms was challenging, and retention was even harder.

### Rider Management
Managing a vast rider network and ensuring timely, accurate deliveries demanded investment in logistics systems.

### Profitability
Charging only $2 per delivery pressured profits.  
Balancing affordability for restaurants and sustainability for Snap Delivered was a delicate act.

---

## Overcoming the Challenges

Snap Delivered adopted several strategies to address these obstacles:

### Built Strategic Partnerships
Collaborated closely with small and medium-sized local restaurants.  
This helped differentiate from large competitors and create an inclusive platform.

### Introduced Customer Incentives
Launched discounts, exclusive deals, and loyalty programs.  
This boosted user acquisition and retention for both customers and restaurants.

### Invested in Platform Upgrades
Improved:

- User experience  
- Delivery route optimization  
- Data analytics for operational efficiency

### Initiated Referral Programs
Allowed individuals and businesses to earn via recruitment and word-of-mouth referrals.  
This fueled organic platform growth without heavy marketing costs.

---

## Launching Version 1.0

- Development of the first version was on a tight deadline.  
- Ninjas Code adopted an **agile approach** to prioritize features and adapt quickly.  
- Regular feedback sessions with the Snap team kept the project aligned with the vision.

---

## The Future for Snap Delivered

Snap Delivered’s strategies have shown positive results:

- Gained traction among local businesses and consumers  
- Carved out a niche in the competitive landscape
