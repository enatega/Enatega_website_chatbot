# Borku: Bringing African Cuisine to Food Delivery

## Introduction
Borku is an emerging food delivery app centered on African cuisine, developed on Enatega and customized by Ninjas Code. With a focus on cultural authenticity and user convenience, Borku aims to create a seamless experience for users craving African flavors. Although Borku remains a work in progress, this case study highlights the significant steps taken to establish a unique and culturally focused platform.

## The Vision: Showcasing African Cuisine
Borku was created to celebrate the diversity of African cuisine through a specialized food delivery platform. To achieve this, the team focused on several key areas:

### Customized Menu Items
Borku required menu options that reflected various African cuisines, showcasing the rich culinary heritage across the continent.

### User-Friendly Interface
A UI and UX overhaul was needed to offer users an engaging, easy-to-navigate platform that embraced African-themed aesthetics.

### Streamlined Onboarding
To attract both riders and restaurants, Borku needed a simplified onboarding process with forms tailored to each group.

### Seamless Payment Integration
Stripe was integrated to enable smooth, secure transactions.

To emphasize the diversity of African food, Borku’s team created unique menu options that cater to regional tastes. This customization allows restaurants to highlight popular dishes, from West African Jollof rice to North African tagines, providing users with a variety of options they won’t find on typical food delivery platforms.

### User Interface and Experience Overhaul
Given the goal of creating a culturally resonant and user-friendly platform, Borku received a comprehensive UI and UX revamp. The design incorporates vibrant, authentic African elements, making the app visually appealing while offering smooth navigation for users.

### Simplified Onboarding with Rider and Restaurant Forms
To encourage engagement with the platform, Borku introduced custom forms to help new riders and restaurants join the network. These forms collect essential information and guide each party through the onboarding process, making it easier for vendors and drivers to start operating on Borku.

### Secure and Convenient Stripe Payment Integration
For reliable and versatile payment handling, Borku integrated Stripe, providing users with a secure, familiar method for completing transactions. This setup also ensures that payments are processed quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Moving Forward with Borku
Borku’s journey is just beginning. With the foundational features now in place, the team is focusing on fine-tuning the user experience and exploring potential enhancements to expand Borku’s appeal.

# Easy Eats: For The Students, By The Students

## Introduction
Easy Eats is a campus and dormitory food delivery service developed by Ninjas Code and powered by Enatega. It is specifically designed for college students who want food delivered to their dorm rooms or within their college campuses. Easy Eats differentiates itself from other food delivery services like UberEats and Grubhub by employing only student drivers and offering more options tailored to college students, while also emphasizing student-focused features.

## Getting Started
Easy Eats began as a passion project by a group of college students aiming to simplify life for their peers on campus. The founders entered the Greenlight Maine competition, which encourages entrepreneurs and innovators from various industries, including college students, to present their ideas for funding and support. Prior to this, Easy Eats collaborated with the Ninjas Code team to develop a solution that catered specifically to college students while incorporating features commonly found in competing services. They sought an app that would attract early investors and provide a unique user experience. The customizability of the Enatega solution facilitated the development of an ideal college food delivery app, despite encountering typical software development challenges.

## The Development Journey
The Easy Eats team outlined the necessary features and customizations for their food delivery application. Following standard development practices, Ninjas Code gathered the requirements from the Easy Eats team and established a step-by-step process for implementing the required features. A clear roadmap was created to keep the development on track and provide a vision of the project timelines.

### Designing A User-Friendly UI/UX
The initial focus for the Ninjas Code team was to create a clean and user-friendly experience for college students who would use the app to order and deliver food. The design team crafted a sleek and intuitive user interface that aligned with the Easy Eats brand. With an easy onboarding flow and a modern user experience, the team successfully brought Easy Eats' vision to life.

### Student-Focused Features
Given that college students were the primary target audience, the app's features were designed with their needs in mind. A key feature was the ability to order food directly to dorm rooms, including options for group ordering to accommodate students sharing dorms.

### Student Driver Onboarding
All riders for the Easy Eats app are fellow students, which is essential for ensuring quick deliveries to dorm rooms. Student drivers are familiar with the college's locations, allowing them to deliver orders directly without getting lost. The Ninjas Code team ensured that the rider onboarding process was straightforward, enabling Easy Eats to onboard as many riders as possible quickly.

### Automatic Payment for Riders and Restaurants
The development team implemented a wallet feature for riders and restaurants, automating the payment process while ensuring accessibility. Both restaurants and riders can transfer funds from their wallets to their accounts almost immediately whenever needed.

## Launching The App
Once all requested features for version 1.0 were completed, the app was ready for launch. The Easy Eats founders participated in the Greenlight Maine competition, where they presented their app to the judges. After showcasing the app's unique features, the Easy Eats team won the competition, receiving $25,000 to expand their operations. Subsequently, they launched the app at their college in Maine and extended operations to nearby universities.

## Overview of the API
### About Our API
Enatega’s API follows a monolithic architecture, meaning the entire software application is developed as a single, unified codebase. Modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications. Enatega uses the Express JS framework and GraphQL for building the API. 

### Resolvers
In GraphQL, resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema. When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.

### Dockerization
Dockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

### Database
Enatega uses MongoDB to manage its database instead of SQL for database management. You can view MongoDB’s documentation by clicking here.

# Snap Delivered: Disrupting The Food Delivery Industry

## Overview
Snap Delivered is a food delivery platform powered by Enatega, similar to other major companies like Foodpanda and UberEats. Launched in 2019, Snap Delivered aims to disrupt the food delivery industry by challenging existing standards regarding rider compensation and delivery fees. The platform offers a transparent delivery process by charging business owners a flat rate of $2 per delivery, which helps level the playing field for restaurants of all sizes.

## Challenges Faced By Snap Delivered

### Highly Competitive Landscape
The food delivery industry is dominated by established players such as UberEats, Grubhub, and DoorDash. Snap Delivered faced significant challenges in gaining market share amidst this competitive environment.

### The Marketplace Dilemma
Attracting both customers and restaurants to the platform was a significant hurdle. Convincing users to switch from their preferred platforms required extensive marketing efforts, and retaining both sides of the marketplace remained an ongoing challenge.

### Rider Management
Managing a large network of delivery riders and ensuring timely deliveries posed complex operational challenges. Snap Delivered needed to invest in reliable logistics and coordination systems to maintain efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### Profitability
Offering a flat rate of $2 per delivery was a bold strategy that pressured Snap Delivered’s profitability. Balancing the need to attract businesses with affordable rates while maintaining a sustainable business model proved to be a delicate task.

## Overcoming The Challenges

### Built Strategic Partnerships
Snap Delivered established strategic partnerships with local restaurants, providing them with a unique value proposition. Collaborating with small and medium-sized businesses allowed Snap Delivered to differentiate itself from larger competitors and create a more inclusive platform.

### Introduced Customer Incentives
To tackle user acquisition and retention challenges, Snap Delivered implemented customer incentives and loyalty programs. Discounts, exclusive deals, and a user-friendly rewards system helped attract and retain both individual customers and restaurants.

### Invested In Platform Upgrades
Recognizing the importance of technology, Snap Delivered continually invested in upgrading its platform. Improvements included enhancing user experience, optimizing delivery routes, and implementing advanced data analytics to boost operational efficiency.

### Initiated Referral Programs
While maintaining an affordable flat rate, Snap Delivered introduced referral programs that allowed individuals to increase their income. This initiative provided various options for both individuals and businesses to earn money through recruitment and word-of-mouth advertising.

## Launching Version 1.0
The development of Snap Delivered's first version was a race against time. The Ninjas Code team adopted an agile development approach, prioritizing features and making adjustments as needed. Regular feedback sessions with the Snap team ensured the project remained aligned with the initial vision.

# StylizeNOW Overview

## Introduction
StylizeNOW is a platform that provides on-demand mobile hair and nail care services. Customers can easily select their desired services through the platform, which then connects them with a stylist.

## What Is StylizeNOW?
StylizeNOW operates as a connection point between customers and licensed professionals for on-demand salon services delivered directly to their homes.

# Enatega's Technical Architecture for Food Delivery Solutions

Enatega employs a sophisticated and modern technical architecture designed to deliver comprehensive food delivery solutions that compete with major platforms such as UberEats, DoorDash, and Foodpanda.

## Customizable Food Delivery Application

Enatega provides a fully realized and customizable food delivery application that enables users to create their own order and delivery management systems. This application features an open-source frontend, complemented by proprietary backend APIs available through paid licensing.

## Backend Infrastructure

The platform's technical foundation is built on Node.js and Express.js. This backend infrastructure supports high-performance server-side operations, allowing for the handling of multiple concurrent orders, real-time tracking, and complex restaurant management workflows essential for food delivery platforms.

## Frontend Ecosystem

The frontend ecosystem utilizes React.js to develop responsive web-based admin dashboards. These dashboards enable restaurant owners and platform administrators to manage orders, menus, and analytics. Additionally, React Native powers cross-platform mobile applications, which include dedicated apps for customers to browse and order food, delivery riders to manage their routes and pickups, and restaurant owners to process incoming orders and update their menus.

## Enhanced Web Presence

Next.js is employed to enhance the platform's web presence through server-side rendering capabilities. This improvement boosts SEO performance and loading speeds for restaurant discovery pages and marketing websites.

## Data Query Language

GraphQL serves as the data query language, facilitating efficient API communication among all components of the multi-vendor food delivery ecosystem. This allows for precise data fetching for real-time order updates, location tracking, and restaurant inventory management.

## Comprehensive Food Delivery Solutions

Enatega's technology stack enables the delivery of complete food delivery solutions. Customers can browse restaurants, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time, while restaurant owners manage their menus and orders. Delivery riders can efficiently complete their routes using GPS integration.

## Scalability and White-Label Solution

The architecture maintains the scalability necessary to support multiple restaurants and thousands of concurrent users across various geographic locations. This makes it an ideal white-label solution for entrepreneurs and established businesses looking to launch their own branded food delivery platforms without incurring the substantial development costs typically associated with building such complex systems from scratch.

# Yalla: Redefining Food and Grocery Delivery Across the Region

Yalla is a dynamic food and grocery delivery app built on Enatega, offering a seamless bilingual experience. Designed for growth, it delivers fast, intuitive service across the regional market.

## Overview

Yalla is a powerful, all-in-one food and grocery delivery app built on the Enatega platform. It is designed to meet the fast-paced demands of a growing customer base, combining intuitive design with modern features to provide a world-class delivery experience in both Arabic and English. This case study highlights how Yalla became a standout player in the regional market and how it continues to grow.

## The Challenges Faced by Yalla

Yalla aimed to address a common frustration in the delivery space: the need to juggle multiple apps for different needs. The goal was to build a single platform that supports:

1. **Multifunctional Deliveries**: Combining food, grocery, and retail orders into one seamless app.
2. **Multi-language Accessibility**: Focusing on Arabic and English to serve diverse communities.
3. **Feature-Rich Functionality**: Standing out in a market dominated by giants like Wolt and Haat.
4. **Localized Payments**: Offering region-specific payment gateways that match local expectations.

To realize this ambitious vision, Yalla required a flexible, scalable solution and a partner capable of delivering quickly without compromising quality.

## The Development Journey

Using Enatega’s white-label framework as a foundation, the Enatega team customized the platform to support more than just food delivery. This included:

- Grocery and retail integration.
- Vendor-side tools for managing complex inventories.
- Support for regional fulfillment models across diverse store types.

This approach gave Yalla an edge from day one, allowing it to serve both restaurants and supermarkets with a unified user experience.

### Phase I: Adapting Enatega for Multifunctional Delivery

Localization was critical. The user interface (UI) was designed to support both right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) languages, enabling seamless toggling between Arabic and English. Every interface element—from navigation to product listings—was carefully translated and culturally adapted.

### Phase II: Building a Multi-Language, User-Centric Interface

To stand out in a saturated market, Yalla introduced:

- Real-time, interactive map views for browsing local vendors.
- Smart search filters for cuisine, price, availability, and dietary needs.
- Personalized recommendations based on user behavior and trends.
- Category-based menus for groceries, food, and essentials.

### Phase III: Developing Market-Leading Features

Yalla required flexible, regionally compliant payment solutions. The Enatega team integrated a local payment provider (HYP), allowing customers to use their credit and debit cards to pay for orders.

### Phase IV: Payment Gateway Customization

## Launch & Results

With a laser-focused agile approach, Yalla’s minimum viable product (MVP) was launched within just a few months. The results were immediate and impressive:

- 60,000+ active monthly users.
- 50+ operational restaurants and vendors onboarded.
- Growing engagement with daily order volume increasing steadily.
- Positive reviews citing UI simplicity and multi-functionality.

Yalla has quickly cemented its reputation as a go-to app in the food and grocery delivery space, and it’s only getting started.
