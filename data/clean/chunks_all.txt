API structure of enatega:
Enatega’s API follows a monolithic architecture, which means that the entire software application is developed as a single, unified codebase. Consequently, any modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications.

Enatega uses the Express JS framework and Graph QL for building the API. You can view the full Graph QL diagram below:
ResolversIn GraphQL, Resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema.
When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.
DockerizationDockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.
DatabaseEnatega uses Mongo DB to manage it’s database instead of SQL for database management.

slug: borku-delivery | chars: 3471

# Borku: Bringing African Cuisine To Food Delivery

## Introduction
Borku is an emerging food delivery app centered on African cuisine, developed on Enatega and customized by Ninjas Code. With a focus on cultural authenticity and user convenience, Borku aims to create a seamless experience for users craving African flavors. Although Borku remains a work in progress, this case study highlights the significant steps taken to establish a unique and culturally focused platform.

## The Vision: Showcasing African Cuisine
Borku was created to celebrate the diversity of African cuisine through a specialized food delivery platform. To achieve this, the team focused on a few key areas:

### Customized Menu Items
Borku required menu options that reflected various African cuisines, showcasing the rich culinary heritage across the continent.

### User-Friendly Interface
A UI and UX overhaul was needed to offer users an engaging, easy-to-navigate platform that embraced African-themed aesthetics.

### Streamlined Onboarding
To attract both riders and restaurants, Borku needed a simplified onboarding process with forms tailored to each group.

### Seamless Payment Integration
Stripe was integrated to enable smooth, secure transactions.

## Key Development Highlights

### Customizing The Menu For African Cuisine
To emphasize the diversity of African food, Borku’s team created unique menu options that cater to regional tastes. This customization allows restaurants to highlight popular dishes, from West African Jollof rice to North African tagines, providing users with a variety of options they won’t find on typical food delivery platforms.

### User Interface And Experience Overhaul
Given the goal of creating a culturally resonant and user-friendly platform, Borku received a comprehensive UI and UX revamp. The design incorporates vibrant, authentic African elements, making the app visually appealing while offering smooth navigation for users.

### Simplified Onboarding With Rider And Restaurant Forms
To encourage engagement with the platform, Borku introduced custom forms to help new riders and restaurants join the network. These forms collect essential information and guide each party through the onboarding process, making it easier for vendors and drivers to start operating on Borku.

### Secure And Convenient Stripe Payment Integration
For reliable and versatile payment handling, Borku integrated Stripe, providing users with a secure, familiar method for completing transactions. This setup also ensures that payments are processed quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Moving Forward With Borku
Borku’s journey is just beginning. With the foundational features now in place, the team is focusing on fine-tuning the user experience and exploring potential enhancements to expand Borku’s appeal. Future updates will continue to celebrate African cuisine, expanding options and improving usability.

## What’s Next For Borku?
Borku’s commitment to cultural authenticity and convenience reflects the versatility of Enatega’s platform and the creative expertise of Ninjas Code. By catering to African cuisine enthusiasts with a customized menu, engaging UI, and user-friendly features, Borku is poised to make a meaningful impact in the food delivery market as development progresses.

## Google Maps API Keys
### Video Walkthrough
Enatega Multivendor | Configuring Google Maps API Key Setup  

1. Log in with your Google Account or establish an account at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
2. Create a project in the Google Cloud Console.
3. Activate the following APIs in your project:
   - Geocoding API
   - Maps Javascript API
   - Places API
   - Maps Elevation API
   - Maps Static API
   - Geolocation API
   - Distance Matrix API
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS

4. Set up the Google Billing account.

5. Go to API & Services > Credentials from the left menu and select “Create Credentials.”  
   - Create a key called HTTP Key, and add your website URL under the website restrictions tab. For example, if your website is my-domain.com, add:
     - https://my-domain.com/*
     - https://www.my-domain.com/*  
   - Ensure you add an asterisk (*) at the end of the URL.

6. Create another key named IP Key and paste your website/server IP address under the IP Addresses section.

### Very Important
The IP address of your website might not always be sufficient to configure the IP limited key in a shared hosting environment. A pop-up notification may appear, indicating an issue with authorization. The message will look like this:  
"Geocoding failed because `This IP, site or mobile application is not authorized to use this API Key. Request received from IP address *.*.*.* with empty referer."  
The *.*.*.* represents your server’s IP address, which needs to be set on the IP Restricted key. Go back to the Google Cloud Console and set this IP Address provided in the popup.

7. Modifications should be made to all modules that require GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY or googleMapsAPIkey, and all modifications should be saved.  
   - It takes Google APIs 5 to 10 minutes to update your website.

## Getting Started
Easy Eats began as a passion project by a group of college students aiming to simplify their peers' lives on campus. The founders entered the Greenlight Maine competition, which encourages entrepreneurs and innovators from various industries, including college students, to present their ideas for funding and support. Prior to this, Easy Eats collaborated with the Ninjas Code team to develop a solution that catered specifically to college students while incorporating features commonly found in competing services. They sought an app that would attract early investors and provide a unique user experience. The customizability of the Enatega solution facilitated the development of an ideal college food delivery app, despite encountering typical software development challenges.

## The Development Journey
The Easy Eats team outlined the necessary features and customizations for their unique food delivery application. Following standard development practices, Ninjas Code gathered the Easy Eats team's requirements and established a step-by-step implementation process. A clear roadmap was created to keep development on track and provide a vision of the project's expected timelines.

### Designing A User-Friendly UI/UX
The Ninjas Code team prioritized creating a clean and user-friendly experience for college students who would use the app to order and deliver food. The design team crafted a sleek and intuitive user interface that aligned with the Easy Eats brand. With an easy onboarding flow and a modern user experience, the team successfully brought Easy Eats' vision to life.

### Student-Focused Features
Given that the primary audience for Easy Eats was college students, the features were tailored to their needs. A significant feature was the ability to order food directly to dorm rooms, including options for group ordering to accommodate students sharing dorms with roommates.

### Student Driver Onboarding
All riders for the Easy Eats app are fellow students, which is essential for ensuring quick deliveries to dorm rooms. Student drivers are familiar with the college's locations, allowing them to deliver orders directly without getting lost. The Ninjas Code team ensured that the rider onboarding process was straightforward, enabling Easy Eats to onboard as many riders as possible quickly.

### Automatic Payment For Riders And Restaurants
The development team implemented a wallet feature for riders and restaurants, automating the payment process while ensuring accessibility. Both restaurants and riders can transfer funds to their accounts directly from their wallets almost immediately whenever they choose.

## Launching The App
Once all requested features for version 1.0 were completed, the app was ready for launch. The Easy Eats founders participated in the Greenlight Maine competition, where they presented their app to the judges. After showcasing the app's unique features, the Easy Eats team won the competition, receiving $25,000 to expand their operations. Subsequently, they launched the app at their college in Maine and expanded to other nearby universities.

# Getting Started

## Introduction

### High-Level Architecture

The high-level architecture of the Enatega platform is designed for seamless interaction between various components.

#### Overview of the API

The user’s mobile application provides access to both the API Server and the Amplitude analytics dashboard. Meanwhile, the web dashboard exclusively communicates with the API Server. The platform features dedicated apps for different stakeholders: the Rider App and the Restaurant App, both of which interface directly with the API Server. 

Additionally, a comprehensive error reporting mechanism is in place, with the Customer App, Restaurant App, Rider App, Web Customer App, and the API Server itself all configured to report issues to Sentry, ensuring robust monitoring and quick resolution of any problems.

### User Roles and Interactions

- **Vendors** create accounts and register restaurants on the system using the Admin Dashboard. They can manage orders, menus, and profiles.
- **Customers** use the mobile/web app to browse restaurant menus, place food orders, and track delivery status.
- **Restaurants** receive and prepare orders made through the platform. They can view orders and update statuses.
- **Riders** are notified of new delivery requests. They can pick up food from restaurants and drop it off to customers, updating statuses through the Rider App.

The API acts as the backend, facilitating communication between all parties and storing/retrieving data in the MongoDB database.

## How to Deploy Admin Dashboard

### Enatega Multivendor | Admin Web Deployment

Initially, we must launch the admin panel and store all the keys using the administrative interface.

1. **Clone or Download Source Code from GitHub**  
   To download Admin Dashboard, click here on Download Admin Dashboard. Node.js must be set up on your computer to run the module. The following commands should be entered in the directory after Node.js has been installed:  
   `cd <Project directory>` (e.g., `cd enatega-multivendor-admin`)

2. **Change constants.js File**  
   You need to change the following credentials in the constants.js file. To change the constants.js file, go to the `src` folder, then go to the `config` folder, where you will find `constants.js`. You are required to incorporate:
   - `value#1` (SERVER_URL)
   - `value#2` (WS_SERVER_URL)
   - `value#3` (GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY)

   Subsequently, all other values will be retrieved from the database once saved through the configuration in the admin panel. Initially, if the values are not yet available from the configuration (database), please hardcode them into the `constants.js` file. The configuration provided below is where you should append the values after executing the admin panel.

slug: lumi-super-ai-app | chars: 3842

Overview

Lumi is Qatar’s first all-in-one AI-powered super app. Built on the Enatega platform, it is a dynamic food and grocery delivery application offering a seamless bilingual experience. Designed for growth, Lumi delivers fast and intuitive services across the regional market.

The platform includes a Web App, Customer App, Admin Panel, and Rider App.

Introduction

Lumi is a next-generation super app based in Qatar. It is built on the Enatega framework and enhanced with proprietary AI extensions to create a unified ride-sharing and food delivery platform.

The Challenge

Lumi set out to address several market needs.

Service Fragmentation
Users in Qatar relied on multiple separate applications for transportation, food delivery, hospitality services, and travel. Lumi aimed to unify these services under one platform.

AI-Driven Personalisation
Traditional service apps in the region lacked intelligent recommendations and adaptive user experiences.

Multi-Service Architecture
Integrating ride sharing, delivery, and future travel services into a single scalable application required rethinking the base architecture.

Local Relevance and Language Support
Qatar’s diverse population required support for both Arabic and English within the same interface.

To meet these demands, Lumi needed a scalable solution that could adapt quickly without compromising performance or user experience.

Development Journey

Lumi’s development was based on the Enatega white-label super app platform, selected for its modular architecture and on-demand service foundation. The framework was extended with a new ride-sharing module that included driver onboarding, trip management, real-time tracking, and dynamic pricing logic.

Stage I: Architectural Enhancement

Artificial intelligence components were added to improve search relevance, tailor ride and food recommendations, and optimise routing for drivers and delivery partners.

Stage II: AI Features Integration

AI capabilities were embedded to enhance personalisation, predictive searches, and contextual service suggestions.

Stage III: Localisation and Language Support

The user interface was fully localised with support for both right-to-left (Arabic) and left-to-right (English) layouts. Cultural and regional preferences guided UI design decisions throughout this stage.

Stage IV: Scalable Modules for Future Services

Hotel booking, flight reservations, and hospitality services were architected as independent modules, allowing them to be enabled without affecting core ride or delivery services.

The development process followed an iterative approach with continuous user testing to validate usability and responsiveness across services.

Key Capabilities
Ride Sharing

Lumi offers fast rider-driver matching with transparent pricing and fare estimates. The experience includes options for tipping, discounts, and feedback, along with real-time tracking, trip updates, preferred language support, and local payment methods.

Food Delivery

The food delivery service includes a wide selection of partner restaurants, seamless ordering with live order tracking, smart recommendations influenced by user behaviour, and integrated maps with delivery ETA visibility.

AI-Powered Enhancements

AI-driven features include intelligent suggestions tailored to user preferences, predictive searches based on prior activity, and context-aware ride and food options.

Scalable Architecture

Lumi is built on a modular architecture designed for future expansion into hotel, flight, and hospitality services. The platform supports shared user accounts across services and a unified payment system.

Launch and Results

Lumi’s rollout focused on stabilising core services in major population centres across Qatar. Early adoption demonstrated strong user interest in combined services.

Key outcomes included rapid adoption with strong user retention, positive feedback on AI recommendations and interface simplicity, smooth onboarding of partner drivers and restaurants, and high engagement across both ride-sharing and food delivery services.

Future Service Expansion

Lumi is designed to extend into additional service areas.

Hotel Booking
Integration with global and regional hotel partners, supported by AI-based stay recommendations.

Flight Booking
Search and booking across airlines with fare predictions and smart alerts.

Hospitality Services
Concierge-level services including home cleaning, laundry, electrician, and other technical services.

Each new capability is designed to integrate naturally within the existing app experience.

Conclusion

Lumi represents a pioneering initiative within Qatar’s digital ecosystem. By combining ride sharing and food delivery with artificial intelligence and a flexible architectural foundation, it delivers a compelling multi-service experience. Built on the Enatega framework and enhanced with customised modules, Lumi is positioned to expand into travel and hospitality while setting a new standard for super apps in the region.

# Overview of the API

## About Our API

Enatega’s API follows a monolithic architecture, which means that the entire software application is developed as a single, unified codebase. Consequently, any modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications. Enatega uses the Express JS framework and GraphQL for building the API. 

You can view the full GraphQL diagram below:

## Resolvers

In GraphQL, resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema. When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.

## Dockerization

Dockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

## Database

Enatega uses MongoDB to manage its database instead of SQL for database management. You can view MongoDB’s documentation by clicking here.

# Products Powered by Enatega

Enatega has successfully powered diverse delivery platforms across multiple industries, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of its open-source solution. From Yalla's multifunctional food and grocery delivery app serving Arabic and English-speaking communities to Snap Delivered's disruptive $2 flat-rate delivery model that has onboarded over 100 stores, these real-world implementations showcase tangible results. Notable successes include Borku's authentic African cuisine platform that saved $100,000 USD in commissions, Easy Eats' investor-backed startup launch targeting college campuses, Vinifynd as the region's first wine delivery solution, and StylizeNow's innovative on-demand styling services that eliminated the need for traditional salon visits.

## Yalla Delivery

Yalla is a powerful, all-in-one food and grocery delivery app built on top of the Enatega platform. Designed to meet the fast-paced demands of a growing customer base, Yalla combines intuitive design with modern features to offer a world-class delivery experience in both Arabic and English. From concept to launch, this case study highlights how Yalla became a standout player in the regional market and how it continues to grow.

Yalla set out to solve a common frustration in the delivery space: juggling multiple apps for different needs. The goal was to build a single platform that supports:

- **Multifunctional Deliveries**: Combining food, grocery, and retail orders into one seamless app.
- **Multi-language Accessibility**: With a focus on Arabic and English to serve diverse communities.
- **Feature-Rich Functionality**: Standing out in a market dominated by giants like Wolt and Haat.

### Key Implementation Details

- The UI was designed to support both right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) languages, enabling seamless toggling between Arabic and English.
- Every interface element—from navigation to product listings—was carefully translated and culturally adapted.
- Real-time, interactive map views for browsing local vendors.
- Smart search filters for cuisine, price, availability, and dietary needs.
- Personalized recommendations based on user behavior and trends.
- Category-based menus for groceries, food, and essentials.
- Integrated local payment provider (HYP) allowing customers to use credit and debit cards.

### Results

With a laser-focused agile approach, Yalla's MVP was launched within just a few months. The results were immediate and impressive. Yalla has quickly cemented its reputation as a go-to app in the food and grocery delivery space, and it's only getting started.

**Note**: The Israeli food and grocery delivery company "Yalla" has a white-label solution from Enatega to enhance its customer service.

Recognizing the importance of technology, Snap Delivered continually invested in upgrading its platform. Improvements included enhancing the user experience, optimizing delivery routes, and implementing advanced data analytics to boost operational efficiency.

### Initiated Referral Programs
While maintaining an affordable flat rate, Snap Delivered introduced referral programs that allowed individuals to increase their income. The various options provided to individuals and businesses meant that anyone involved with Snap Delivered could earn money through recruitment, word-of-mouth advertisement, or referrals.

# Enatega's Technical Architecture for Food Delivery Solutions

Enatega employs a sophisticated and modern technical architecture designed to deliver comprehensive food delivery solutions that compete with major platforms such as UberEats, DoorDash, and Foodpanda.

## Customizable Food Delivery Application

Enatega provides a fully realized and customizable food delivery application that enables users to create their own order and delivery management systems. This application features an open-source frontend, complemented by proprietary backend APIs available through paid licensing.

## Backend Infrastructure

The platform's technical foundation is built on Node.js and Express.js. This backend infrastructure supports high-performance server-side operations, allowing for the handling of multiple concurrent orders, real-time tracking, and complex restaurant management workflows essential for food delivery platforms.

## Frontend Ecosystem

The frontend ecosystem utilizes React.js to develop responsive web-based admin dashboards. These dashboards enable restaurant owners and platform administrators to manage orders, menus, and analytics. Additionally, React Native powers cross-platform mobile applications, which include dedicated apps for customers to browse and order food, delivery riders to manage their routes and pickups, and restaurant owners to process incoming orders and update their menus.

## Enhanced Web Presence

Next.js is employed to enhance the platform's web presence through server-side rendering capabilities. This improvement boosts SEO performance and loading speeds for restaurant discovery pages and marketing websites.

## Data Query Language

GraphQL serves as the data query language, facilitating efficient API communication among all components of the multi-vendor food delivery ecosystem. This allows for precise data fetching for real-time order updates, location tracking, and restaurant inventory management.

## Comprehensive Food Delivery Solutions

Enatega's technology stack enables the delivery of complete food delivery solutions. Customers can browse restaurants, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time, while restaurant owners manage their menus and orders. Delivery riders can efficiently complete their routes using GPS integration.

## Scalability and White-Label Solution

The architecture maintains the scalability necessary to support multiple restaurants and thousands of concurrent users across various geographic locations. This makes it an ideal white-label solution for entrepreneurs and established businesses looking to launch their own branded food delivery platforms without incurring the substantial development costs typically associated with building such complex systems from scratch.

# Yalla: Redefining Food and Grocery Delivery Across the Region

Yalla is a dynamic food and grocery delivery app built on Enatega, offering a seamless bilingual experience. Designed for growth, it delivers fast, intuitive service across the regional market.

## Overview

Yalla is a powerful, all-in-one food and grocery delivery app built on the Enatega platform. It is designed to meet the fast-paced demands of a growing customer base, combining intuitive design with modern features to offer a world-class delivery experience in both Arabic and English. 

This case study highlights how Yalla became a standout player in the regional market and how it continues to grow.

## The Challenges Faced by Yalla

Yalla set out to solve a common frustration in the delivery space: juggling multiple apps for different needs. The goal was to build a single platform that supports:

- **Multifunctional Deliveries**: Combining food, grocery, and retail orders into one seamless app.
- **Multi-language Accessibility**: Focusing on Arabic and English to serve diverse communities.
- **Feature-Rich Functionality**: Standing out in a market dominated by giants like Wolt and Haat.
- **Localized Payments**: Offering region-specific payment gateways that match local expectations.

To bring this ambitious vision to life, Yalla needed a flexible, scalable solution—and a partner that could deliver quickly without compromising quality.

## The Development Journey

Using Enatega’s white-label framework as a foundation, the Enatega team customized the platform to support more than just food delivery. This included:

- Grocery and retail integration.
- Vendor-side tools for managing complex inventories.
- Support for regional fulfillment models across diverse store types.

This gave Yalla an edge from day one, as it could serve both restaurants and supermarkets with a unified user experience.

### Phase I: Adapting Enatega for Multifunctional Delivery

Localization was critical. The UI was designed to support both right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) languages, enabling seamless toggling between Arabic and English. Every interface element—from navigation to product listings—was carefully translated and culturally adapted.

### Phase II: Building a Multi-Language, User-Centric Interface

To stand out in a saturated space, Yalla introduced:

- Real-time, interactive map views for browsing local vendors.
- Smart search filters for cuisine, price, availability, and dietary needs.
- Personalized recommendations based on user behavior and trends.
- Category-based menus for groceries, food, and essentials.

### Phase III: Developing Market-Leading Features

Yalla needed flexible, regionally compliant payment solutions. The Enatega team integrated a local payment provider (HYP), allowing customers to use their credit and debit cards to pay for orders.

### Phase IV: Payment Gateway Customization

## Launch & Results

With a laser-focused agile approach, Yalla’s MVP was launched within just a few months. The results were immediate and impressive:

- 60,000+ active monthly users.
- 50+ operational restaurants and vendors onboarded.
- Growing engagement with daily order volume increasing steadily.
- Positive reviews citing UI simplicity and multi-functionality.

Yalla has quickly cemented its reputation as a go-to app in the food and grocery delivery space, and it’s only getting started.

## 6.2 Firebase for Mobile Services

- **Create Project**: Create a new Firebase project (do **not** uncheck the measurement ID switch box)[cite: 126, 106].
- **Register Apps**: Register both an **iOS** app and an **Android** app in the Firebase project, ensuring the bundle identifier/package name matches the one in `app.json` (e.g., `com.customer.app`)[cite: 127, 128, 129].
- **Download `google-services.json`**: Download the `google-services.json` file from the Android app's settings[cite: 130]. This file is collective and will include details for all registered mobile clients (Customer, Restaurant, Rider)[cite: 154, 155].
- **Update App Code**: Paste the file into the mobile app's directory, replacing any existing file[cite: 130, 131].
- **VAPID Key**: Generate a VAPID key pair in Firebase Cloud Messaging[cite: 112].
  - Paste this key into the **`Firebase Admin`** configuration section of the **Admin Portal**[cite: 112, 113].
- **Service Account Key**: In Firebase **Project Settings** > **Service Accounts**, generate a new private key[cite: 135]. This key is a complete JSON object used for authentication[cite: 136].
  - Paste the content of this key into the app's Google service account file[cite: 136].

## 6.3 Google OAuth Client IDs

- **Consent Screen**: In the Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** and configure the OAuth consent screen (select **External**)[cite: 146, 147].
- **Get Fingerprints**: After a successful Expo production build, retrieve the **SHA-1** and **SHA-256** fingerprints from the app's credentials in Expo[cite: 144, 145].
  - **SHA-256** is used in the Firebase app configuration[cite: 145].
- **Create Client IDs**: Create four separate OAuth Client IDs in the Google Cloud Console:
  - **Web Application**: Used for both Admin and Customer Portals. Enter both local (`localhost:3000`) and production (Netlify) JavaScript origins and redirect URLs[cite: 147, 148].
  - **Android**: Match the `package name` from `app.json` and paste the **SHA-1 fingerprint** from Expo[cite: 149, 150].
  - **iOS**: Match the `bundle identifier` from `app.json`[cite: 151].
  - **Expo Proxy**: Create another Web Application ID with `https://auth.expo.io` as the URL, appending your Expo owner name and app slug to the redirect URL[cite: 151, 152].
- **Update Admin Portal**: Paste all four generated Client IDs into the **Google Credentials** section of the **Admin Portal**[cite: 152, 153].

## 6.4 Mobile App Development Builds

- **Login to Expo**: Log in via the terminal using `EAS login`[cite: 138].
- **Configure Build**: Use the command `EAS build:configure`[cite: 139, 157].
- **Build**: Use `EAS build --platform Android --profile production` for a production APK, or `EAS build --platform iOS --profile development` for an iOS simulator build[cite: 139, 157].
- **Local Run**: Run the app locally using `npm Run start`, then select **'A'** (Android) or **'I'** (iOS) in the Expo go prompt to open the simulator/emulator[cite: 160, 161]. The process is repeated for the Restaurant and Rider apps[cite: 162].
