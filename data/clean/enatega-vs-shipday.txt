## Overview Of Enatega And Shipday

Enatega is a versatile, fully customizable delivery platform designed to support diverse service sectors. With options for food, grocery, courier, and more, Enatega enables businesses to create tailored, branded experiences. 

Shipday, on the other hand, is a delivery management solution focused on real-time tracking and efficient dispatching for local businesses. While it offers quick setup options, customization is limited, making it ideal for straightforward delivery operations rather than complex, multi-service models.
