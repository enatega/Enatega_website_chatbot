### How to Deploy Web Dashboard
To deploy the Enatega Multivendor web dashboard, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download Source Code**: Click here to download the Web Application.
2. **Node.js Setup**: Ensure Node.js is set up on your computer.
3. **Change Credentials**: Update the credentials in the `constants.js` file. You will need to modify ‘value#1’ and ‘value#2’. The remaining values will be retrieved from the configuration (database) once added through the admin panel. If these values are not obtained, hardcode them in the `constants.js` file.

### Environment Variables
Here’s an explanation of each variable in the `.env` file for your web application:

- **REACT_APP_SERVER_URL**: Specifies the base URL of your backend server for API requests.
- **REACT_APP_WS_SERVER_URL**: Defines the WebSocket server URL for real-time communication.

### Understanding APIs
An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software applications to communicate. The backend API handles data and requests on the server side.

### Hosting Services
To make your API accessible on the internet, you need a hosting service. Options include cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Digital Ocean, or specialized services like Railway Cloud.

## How to Deploy Backend API
Deploying your API server involves uploading your code, configuring the server, and ensuring it is operational.
