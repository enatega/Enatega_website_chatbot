# Installation

## How To Setup Customer App

1. **Clone or Download Source Code from GitHub**  
   To download the Customer App, click here on Download Enatega Multivendor.  
   **Note:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer to launch the module.

2. **Open the Enatega MultiVendor Code**  
   After installing Node.js, open the Enatega MultiVendor code in a code editor.

3. **Run the Enatega MultiVendor App**  
   Open it in the integrated terminal by:
   - Right-clicking on the enatega-multivendor-app folder and selecting “Open in Integrated Terminal” 
   - Or by using the following command in the terminal:  
     `cd <Project directory>`  
     For example: `cd enatega-multivendor-app`

4. **Testing the Customer App**  
   To test the Customer App (if you don’t have your own server URL) and check the look and feel, no changes are needed.  
   To run the customer app against your own server URL, go to the environment.js file and replace the following in environment.js:  
   - GRAPHQL_URL  
   - WS_GRAPHQL_URL  
   - SERVER_URL  
   - Google_MAPS_KEY  

5. **Running the Customer App**  
   After completing all the configurations, it’s time to run the Customer App. Open the terminal and run the following commands:  
   `npm install` (or `yarn install`)  
   `npm start`  

   When you run the commands, you have two options to run your app:  
   - **Development Build**  
   - **Using Expo Go**  
     To run the app using Expo Go, press S to switch to Expo Go from the development build. You can either:
     - Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code to run the app.
     - Use an iOS or Android simulator to run the app.  
     
   **Note:** The “Continue with Google” feature may not work in the Expo Go app due to certain limitations. The package react-native-google-signin used for Google login does not work on Expo managed projects. For a seamless experience, and to easily run the app in the Expo Go app and Expo simulator, we have removed it. “Continue with Google” is available in production.  
   **Reference:** [React Native Google Signin Documentation](https://react-native-google-signin.github.io/docs/setting-up/expo)
