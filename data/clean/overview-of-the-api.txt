# Overview of the API

## About Our API

Enatega’s API follows a monolithic architecture, which means that the entire software application is developed as a single, unified codebase. Consequently, any modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications. Enatega uses the Express JS framework and GraphQL for building the API. 

You can view the full GraphQL diagram below:

## Resolvers

In GraphQL, resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema. When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.

## Dockerization

Dockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

## Database

Enatega uses MongoDB to manage its database instead of SQL for database management. You can view MongoDB’s documentation by clicking here.
