## Getting Started

### Introduction
Enatega’s API follows a monolithic architecture, meaning the entire software application is developed as a single, unified codebase. Modifications made to one section of the code will impact the entire application. Various functionalities like logging, caching, and performance monitoring are encompassed within a single application. This approach simplifies management and facilitates connections with other components and applications.

### High-Level Architecture
Enatega uses the Express JS framework and GraphQL for building the API. You can view the full GraphQL diagram below.

## Overview of the API

### Resolvers
In GraphQL, resolvers are functions that define how to retrieve or mutate data for a specific field in a GraphQL schema. When a client sends a query or mutation to a GraphQL API, the server uses resolvers to determine how to fetch or manipulate the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver function that knows how to resolve that specific field.

### Dockerization
Dockerization is the process of packaging and deploying software applications within isolated containers. By Dockerizing an application, it becomes encapsulated within a lightweight, portable container that includes all the necessary dependencies and libraries. This containerization allows the application to run consistently and reliably across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

### Database
Enatega uses MongoDB to manage its database instead of SQL for database management. You can view MongoDB’s documentation by clicking here.
